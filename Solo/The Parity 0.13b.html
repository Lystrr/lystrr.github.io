&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, mom. I&#39;m going to bed. Now. Seriously.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She didn&#39;t leave your room. You sighed loudly and switched your notebook off. Your mom watched you carefully.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;You look good, dear.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; It wasn&#39;t a compliment. It was a statement. You&#39;ll go tomorrow to school after two week absence. &lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Good night.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You woke up several times having this disturbing feeling that you were being observed, and it wasn&#39;t someone friendly. Before you managed to fall again into restless slumber, you were listening carefully for a while. You expected to hear someone&#39;s heavy breath or sneaking footsteps. But no, the only sound you heard was quiet music from your father&#39;s office room. Apparently he was listening to the soundtrack from &quot;Blues Brothers&quot; while finishing his project. Surprisely you felt calmed by your father&#39;s presence. You corrected the blanket so that your feet didn&#39;t stick out, as you did as a small kid who was constantly scared by imaginary monsters. Finally, exhausted by these awakenings, you plunged deeper into dreaming.

You hadn&#39;t had such a dream before. You were fully aware that you weren&#39;t awake. But still, everything felt real. You even feel a weak wind stroking your hair.

You were in front of &#39;&#39;Rosset High School&#39;&#39;. A grim, squat building from the nineteenth century, it was repulsive as always. So was the bust of the patroness, Alice Rosset, who was named by all students: &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39;. The stone statue was normally set so that her face was directed to the school building, which is unusual because statues normally faced the street. But each kid from this school knew that it wasn&#39;t a coincidence. &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; observed her prey: the students.

Therefore, in this dream, she was looking directly at you and you suddenly recognized this unfriendly presence that you were feeling during the night. So you finally got &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;s&#39;&#39; attention. You shuddered.

There was a small, paved square between the street and the school. It was full of people from school. Everyone was looking at you with a wide smile that scared you even more. This crowd was waiting for you.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hey, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, so you&#39;ve finally came,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; said the familiar voice.  It was &lt;&lt;textbox &quot;$they.oliviaFemaleName&quot; &quot;Olivia&quot;&gt;&gt;, one of the closest people in your life. But she looked different. In real life, she was a rather plain girl, skinny, tall and crazy. She had great charisma and nothing could shock her. But in this dream, she was incredibly sexy. She drew near slowly, bouncing the curves she was lacking in reality. You felt hot. Damn, she was turning you on. 

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;And you will come again, I promise you,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she whispered to your ear. And without any further invitation, she kissed you passionately. Her slender hand reached your groin. The grind of your zipper seemed to sound extremely unnaturally loud.

People around you started to laugh and encourage you. Your friend tasted so good. She nearly stewed you with tongue in your mouth while she was undressing you.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Are we...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; -- you panted -- &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;doing this in front of everyone?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She smiled and grabbed your cock. You couldn&#39;t stop the moan. A crowd started to cheer.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Do you really care?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she asked slyly.&lt;/p&gt;[[No, lets do it.|In public]] &lt;&lt;flashy $display&gt;&gt;

People had to back off, because in passion you and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; didn&#39;t care if you bumped into somebody. You quickly dropped your clothes. When she finally leaned against &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;s&#39;&#39; bust, she wore only very sexy lingerie. Her panties were soaked with her juices. You stood in front of her in boxers. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; smiled and reached her hand to your bulge.


&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Time to unpack presents,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said. Her voice, a little scratched, drove you crazy even before her slender fingers touched your cock. She slowly lowered your boxers, then she ruffled your balls. You moaned loudly. You felt you would explode.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Now, practice with a bra,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she demanded. She turned around. Your impatient fingers desperately tightened on the straps of her bra. You fought with them for a while, but finally, the last barrier between you and her breasts fell off. You made her face you and admired her perfect body. One more smooth move and you revealed her pussy. You were so excited.

When you both were naked, she stuck to you and got around to your cock seriously. Your world flashed in the ecstasy.&lt;/p&gt;[[You came.|You cum]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="In private" tags="auntie" position="1971,343" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;defiance $auntie&gt;&gt;

Having sex with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was one thing, but doing this in front of the whole school was something different. You looked around.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, you are shy!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she exclaimed slyly. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe you shouldn&#39;t be,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she added stroking your cock. You moaned and then kissed her impatiently, hard. Still, people around you, who were laughing and pointing at you, were really distracting.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; sighed.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You are such a showman, aren&#39;t you? Come on, let&#39;s go. We should be fucking right now.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She released your cock and guided to you the school. It looked different than in reality. The heavy, red curtains fit an old, nineteenth-century building. The corridors were empty.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;So, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, are you ha...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She didn&#39;t finish the sentence, because you closed her mouth with a deep kiss. You started to undress her, which was a difficult task as she was stroking your cock all the time. Finally, you both were naked. You caress her breasts for a moment, then you reached lower, to her wet pussy...&lt;/p&gt;[[You came.|You cum]]

Because — you told yourself — it&#39;s some &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;s&#39;&#39; trick. She wanted you to fuck. It was the way she fed on students. And you knew she was a dangerous, demonic bitch.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Babe,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; said with a very confident smile. She smelled incredible, you realized. You were adoring her using every sense. Her hand was again very close to your cock. She started to play with your belt. Your erection started to hurt. You had never been so hard in your whole life.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t keep me waiting,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said. She took your hand and put it on her soft breast.

Everything here was strange. You noticed that students there didn&#39;t blink. Their wide smiles seemed to be stationary, like they were painted or stuck to their faces. People themselves also looked artificial.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;What do you find more interesting than me, babe?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she asked slyly. She grabbed your hand. You felt the wave of heat that went through your body but concentrating on your cock. You moaned.

She giggled.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You see? There&#39;s nothing like me here. Come on.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She kissed you. Her fingers wandered on your body. Her touch was incredible. She avoided your cock, you knew she was teasing you.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You have to ask me,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she whispered and licked your ear.

You cleaned your throat.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;What... What about the clock?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you asked. It was your last independent thought. You heard the ticking of the clock. It was quiet, but you knew it was important. The rhythm penetrated everything in this dream. It influenced the people around - they seemed to totter in this tact. You realized that even  &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; caresses and her hot breaths were in that rhythm.

But she didn&#39;t answer.

Her &#39;&#39;Anger&#39;&#39; could manifest in many ways, but remember that trickery is her main way of acting.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you felt it. The anger of the powerful mind that was overwhelming you.

&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;You are the man&quot;)&gt;&gt;You stood up, naked and alarmed. You realized that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; disappeared. &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;In public&quot;)&gt;&gt; So the other people.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You looked out the window.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; The square was empty. Only the statue of &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; was staring at you and that gaze made you tremble.

You quickly put your jeans and shoes on. You felt that you were an intruder. You ran through the square. You somehow knew you needed to leave the school&#39;s ground. Every second you spent in the presence of this anger was pulsing with pain in your head.

Then you reached the gate. You felt a great relief. You didn&#39;t dare to turn around. 
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $dreamSex = false&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;You decidedly took &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; hand and hid your cock back to your boxers. You corrected the shirt and jeans. You smiled at her, but she winced. When you saw her grimace you realized that a girl in front of you didn&#39;t look like &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; anymore. Her eyes were darker, her teeth too white and her mouth too wide.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Am I not good enough for you, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she snarled. She clenched fists and you saw her fingers were sharp too.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Not this way.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you answered. You hoped she would calm down, but she went furious. 

People in the square started to yell at you, but you didn&#39;t recognize the single words. But it was a scream full of hate. Everybody started to move in your direction. You decided to retreat, but you didn&#39;t dare to turn around from then, so you walked backward. You felt the anger, but it seemed to bring out from the &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;s&#39;&#39; statue. The bust was staring at you intensively. Luckily, you finally reached the school&#39;s gate.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;[[Then you woke up.|Wake up]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="You cum" tags="auntie" position="2149,283" size="100,100">&lt;p&gt;You lasted maybe a dozen seconds of her touch until you ejaculated.

But after this moment of great pleasure, you felt guilty. Sex wasn&#39;t chess, you could impress anyone by finishing after three moves.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I am sorry, I...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;  you started, but &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; put a finger on your mouth. She licked your cum from her fingers.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t worry, babe. This won&#39;t end like that.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You realized you were still hard. It was a strange feeling - you were fulfilled and voracious at the same time. You wanted her. The lust you felt was the same desire you saw in her eyes.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; started to kiss you again, with a force and energy that surprised you. You were practically wrestling and you felt she was stronger. She forced you to sit, then to lie down. She grabbed your cock and played with it for a while.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ll do what I always wanted,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said.

You were tempted to let her do what she planned. So far, it felt good.

Lying on your back, you even didn&#39;t see well what she was doing. You could only feel the sensations.

Strange, but she seemed to concentrate on your chest. She licked and pinched your nipples. It felt really good, but you were sure that would feel better for a woman, not you. When she bit one and blew you were confused. Before you protested, she started to stroke your cock again which made you forget about it. You moaned loudly. She definitely knew the spots.

Suddenly she stopped. You heard her chuckle. You managed to focus. The words she spoke sobered you up.

So you grabbed her hands and decidedly made her lie on her back. You were kissing her, so hard and deep that your teeth hit hers. Your impatient hands were crushing her breasts, then you reached lower. She panted and moaned right into your mouth. You felt like a real man. You could satisfy your woman.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; struggled with you. She wanted to take the initiative. Her attempts made you hornier. She was a dominating girl, sure, so it took time before you took advantage.

You spread her legs. You rubbed her clitoris. Her hot juices felt wonderful. You were ready. More than ready.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Wait!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she exclaimed. 

You didn&#39;t want to. You enter her rapidly. She squeaked loudly. You were penetrating her deeply. You&#39;d never felt such delight. When you finally ejaculated, your world exploded in total bliss.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Ooo... Fuck... Fuck...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You chuckled. You looked at her sweating face.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Talkative as always!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said grinning.

She winced. She was still panting.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You idiot!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said with sudden anger. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You ruined everything!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I am so happy about you,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she hissed and kissed you. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;They are pretty, don&#39;t you think?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You sprang to your feet. Your breasts bounced. Shocked, you touched them. They felt so real.

You realized she was right. Your nipples, bigger and darker than they used to, felt really good. You felt them more than your cock, which scared you more. Did you still have it? Because of your breasts, you couldn&#39;t see your crotch and you were afraid to touch it.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she sang your name. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Why are you like this?

But you knew already, that she didn&#39;t act or talked like &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. She even didn&#39;t look like her, not anymore. Her eyes shone too bright, her teeth were too white and sharp. There was something about her hair. It was... swarming.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; nodded. She blew you a kiss.

You checked time on your phone. 6:45 AM. You lived near school, so you had a few moments left before you had to get up. You didn&#39;t consider a quick nap. You felt exhausted, but had no need to sleep. Or to lay in this wet bed either.

You sighed and got up. With disgust, you peeled off the sheet from your back. When you stood on your feet, you felt you were extremely thirsty.

No, not thirsty.

You felt //drained//.

Fuck you, &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39;. You hated this bitch. You remained male after the first day at Rosset High School, so you&#39;d probably save your ability to piss standing-up, but it didn&#39;t mean that you were grateful.

You went to the kitchen and nearly sucked the tap. You drank at least a liter of water. Finally, panting and swearing quietly, you came back to your bedroom. You started to think.

Fortunately, &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Bigger than mine&quot;)&gt;&gt;you didn&#39;t have breasts, however the memory of feeling the heavy flesh at your chest remained very vivid&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Fortunately, you didn&#39;t find any wounds you remembered from the dream, but the recollection of pain remained.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;.

A dream... You remembered that during your freshman year you had some dreams about the school, &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; had some role in them, and you were worried about them. Comparing them to this vision, you were sure they were just a reflection of your stress, worries, and the fact that your school was cursed.

Your alarm clock started to buzz.&lt;/p&gt;[[Time to school]]&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Her parents were zealots who spent more time in church than at home, so she grew as a wild child in the street. Your father probably spent more time with her than her own family. As they had many things in common, your mother once joked that maybe &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was really your half-sister. Your father answered that he would have to grow a beard and pretend to be Jesus to seduce &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; mother. 

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was a tomboy and the real chief of your gang. She used her influence on you to drag you into trouble.

Your phone started to buzz.

She already had a call and it wasn&#39;t even 7.00 A.M.! You heard so many stories about lazy officials, but your mother rarely came from the office at the time she should. Your father joked sometimes that she was a firefighter. In fact, she acted like one.

Your father snored from your parents&#39; bedroom. You saw four cups in the sink, so he probably went to bed so late that it was actually early in the morning. You wondered if he heard something. Maybe moaning, for example. You&#39;d probably never know.

You didn&#39;t really want to go to school, but you realized it was useless not to go. You had been an adult, sure, for three months now, but it didn&#39;t change much. You just coudn&#39;t lie to your mother, she was like a living truth detector. She worked with junkies, drunkards, and poor but smart people, so she had to be. And every single day you skipped school she treated like a signal you&#39;d never finish your education. Sometimes you could count on your father, but you were sure that after two weeks of your absence he would take her side.

So you grabbed some clothes and took a quick shower. &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Bigger than mine&quot;)&gt;&gt;You looked carefully at your chest, but it was flat as always.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; You dressed up and packed your bag. You kissed your mother for goodbye and left.

Anyway, you talked with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; a lot and she said that nothing happened.

You got a scholarship last year and you want that money this year too. Besides that, you would finish high school next year and you had to think about your future.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

So you were quite calm about this day, even a math lesson didn&#39;t make you sweat, however many kids in school had nightmares about it and talked about it to their therapists.

&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You passed the entrance to the park. There was a statue and the fountain. As you and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; were raised in the neighborhood, it was your usual place for meetings. When you were little kids, you used to throw coins in the fountain and make wishes. Two months ago, when you both were absolutely drunk,  you took some coins out of the  water, because you needed some for a beer. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; named it a refund of the long-term investment. 

You sat on the lining. Of course it wasn&#39;t fifteen minutes, because &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; lateness  was legendary. So, as usual, when she appeared at last , she practically ran. 

Well, she didn&#39;t look like in your dream. You didn&#39;t know if you felt more relief or sadness about that. For sure, her life would be easier if she looked like in the vision. But you knew she was fine with herself in a state practically unavailable for typical teenage girls. 

She had short dark hair and a rather pale complexion. She barely used any makeup. She usually grinned in the way you would expect on the Cheshire Cat, if he was a schoolgirl from cursed high school. She didn&#39;t care much about her clothing. You probably never saw her in a skirt since kindergarten. She usually wore combat pants, as she could hold nearly everything in the pockets. 

She kissed you delicately on the cheek, which reminded you of a far more passionate kiss.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Let&#39;s go before I&#39;ll kill us,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she exclaimed with a wry smile. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I am one of the most dangerous killers in this world!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Killers should be dangerous for others, not for themselves,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said smiling.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Didn&#39;t you hear about the suicide terrorists? I am one of them. Totally!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said with comic pride . &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I can use a pancake as a murder weapon! I will kill many innocent people, if you let me. So, you know,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she smiled widely, &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;you have to cook for us for the sake of these all women and children. But you can wait until I&#39;ll kill &lt;&lt;textbox &quot;$they.carlMaleName&quot; &quot;Carl&quot;&gt;&gt;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

It was a good idea.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I can&#39;t let you murder him,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you opposed. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You swore you would let me do this!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you reminded her. He was your true enemy since your fresh year.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; pulled a face.
 
&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You can&#39;t take my promises seriously when I am drunk!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Well, it was definitely the same &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; you knew your whole life. Would you talk with her about the dream?&lt;/p&gt;[[Yes, it could be important.|Talk about dream - Yes]]

It would be awkward after this dream. So you wrote her back that you would see her at school. Besides, you didn&#39;t want to be late and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; just couldn&#39;t be on time anywhere.

So you went to school. It was been the first time for two weeks that you were out. It was a warm, sunny, spring day. It was a day you would like to spend outside, not in the cold, grim walls of &#39;&#39;Rosset High School&#39;&#39;. At least you had a nice walk to school. There was a large park where you spent most of your childhood. While you were going through, you sometimes looked back to the old times. Well, your neighborhood had changed a lot. It wasn&#39;t safe then. Drunk, aggressive men bothered the passers-by, even during the day. Your parents constantly reminded you to watch your steps because of shards of broken bottles lying everywhere. At night, no reasonable man dared to go into the park. The cries and shouts reminded you of a horror movie.

Nowadays it was a civilized, safe place. Young women jogged here on evenings. There were security guards and clean benches. Even the ruins of Russian forts of the nineteenth century were renovated and adapted for restaurants. So, the change was undeniable. But then you often were hanging around with your childhood friends, and now you were alone.

But not for long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $relations.baseBoys lte 2&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was true to say that the park was generally a safe place. But even in the safest place you could be in danger if you met bad people. And for you, these bad people were your classmates.&lt;/p&gt;
[[Or cellmates as you called them.|Your cellmates]]&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $relations.baseBoys gte 3&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The park was a popular place for the students of &#39;&#39;Rosset High School&#39;&#39;. So it was easy to meet someone. You heard the male voices that called your name.&lt;/p&gt;

You turned around and saw a group of your classmates. You missed them during your illness. The fast pace of high school life left you behind. Social media let you stay in touch, but you needed to be in the middle of the action to take part in the most important events. In fact, you were excluded from the most important events.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Lookin&#39; good, man! Aren&#39;t you contagious anymore?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I tried to be, to infect the old harpy,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;But the drugs they gave me were too good.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Shame! Maybe you&#39;d try, anyway? I need that bitch to be absent for a few weeks. It&#39;s my only hope to pass!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, dude! I will spit in her face for you!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks, dude!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You went together. A typical, vulgar, and loud group of teenage boys. Of course, they missed you during these two weeks. As you were born in January, you came to age already, so you served the crucial role of alcohol provider. It was another sign of changes in your neighborhood - it got harder for the underaged to buy drinks. So, you were sure your classmates were really sorry you weren&#39;t at the last party.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hey, look! &lt;&lt;textbox &quot;$they.marthaFemaleName&quot; &quot;Martha&quot;&gt;&gt;&#39;s there.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Your heart suddenly raced, as always when you saw her. She wasn&#39;t simply beautiful. She was sensational. However she dressed in modest clothes for school, but even so she was like a living wet dream. If you dreamed about her, &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; couldn&#39;t change anything in her.

And she noticed you too. She waved.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, guys!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she exclaimed. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;! I was thinking about you! Are you ready?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;  

You smiled. That girl had such a sweet voice.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You can&#39;t be really ready for Monday.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She got serious. She looked at your classmates. A deathly hush fell.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;You didn&#39;t say him a word, did you?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she asked quietly.

To your surprise, the guys were embarrassed.

She snorted.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Wow, guys. I&#39;m really impressed. Male solidarity indeed. You would rather be a dick than lose one, hm?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; Then she turned to you. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;And &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; also didn&#39;t warn you?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You started to worry. 

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Warn me?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; You repeated.

She rolled her eyes.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Wow, man. You have some real friends. I didn&#39;t expect... Anyway...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;[[Auntie will hug one of the boys today.|Carl&#39;s plan]]

You heard a voice and then a laughter. You turned around and saw your classmates. There was a whole group of them, mostly boys, but some girls were there too. You cursed your own stupidity. Of course, this was the place where from time immemorial  the students of &#39;&#39;Rosset High School&#39;&#39; went to smoke  before school. 

You decided to ignore them. The school was nearby and it was a public place, so it was safe to do that.

And, who knows, maybe you&#39;d make it. But this time it wasn&#39;t only the group from your class. Some senior guy grabbed you and made you stop.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s not polite to act like that,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said grinning.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s not how fair ladies behave!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; shouted a senior girl laughing. Her comment caused the avalanche of laughter. Suddenly you were crowded by people from your school. One boy took a photo of you.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Fresh delivery to my fap folder,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he explained, which caused more comments and laughs.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hey, you, give me your phone number,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; demanded another guy.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;O, how sneaky! You know, maybe he wouldn&#39;t give it to you later!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; shouted the girl who wanted to teach you manners.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe he wouldn&#39;t, maybe SHE will!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he replied, totally relaxed. 

Students were touching you and pointing at you. You weren&#39;t stupid. You knew what it was all about. &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; was going to hug someone today and apparently you were nominated.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hey, guys, make some space. Have you bought tickets? We&#39;ll run a striptease later!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You recognized this voice immediately, even in a crowd. Someone grabbed your arm. You saw this familiar, cheeky face. It was &lt;&lt;textbox &quot;$they.carlMaleName&quot; &quot;Carl&quot;&gt;&gt;, your true nemesis. 

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Do you see how many people want to hang with you, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he asked. &lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Your better life starts today!

You looked at her, shocked.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Are you kidding me, right?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you asked.

But the glances your friends exchanged were the best confirmation. 

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Our twin sisters finally moved out,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; explained. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;So we have a vacancy... And &lt;&lt;textbox &quot;$they.carlMaleName&quot; &quot;Carl&quot;&gt;&gt; wants you to fill it. He convinced some boys to... well... treat you like a girl today.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Your whole world dropped out from under you. So that was what that dream was about? &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; was looking for a boy who&#39;d be transformed into a girl, to align the number of girls and boys in your class. Did she want to look at you closer? And your worst enemy is setting you up? And no one warned you? Any of your friends? 

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; looked at you with compassion on her beautiful face. She put her hand on your shoulder.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;You know, this is humbug, you can&#39;t influence &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; that way,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she assured you.

That&#39;s all. Easy to say. You decided to...&lt;/p&gt;[[...show your anger.|Angry]] &lt;&lt;forceful $display&gt;&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; smiled even wider when he stood next to you. He was a slim guy - you were taller than him by about 2-3 inches. His bullying skills were based on his sense of humor, fast-talking and cruelty.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, well, well,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he almost sang. &lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;What are we having here? Rather a flat-chested girl in the beginning of her road to the womanhood.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hey, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; shouted the guy who took a photo of you. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You said it was all settled, that he&#39;s a pussy, but now you are bleeding!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s his time of the month,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said and senior students laughed. You earned some sympathy from the public.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Fuck off, dickhead,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you hissed. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Even if &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; will hug me today, I will always be able to kick your ass.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; groaned quietly. You turned around. Older students congratulated you. You shook some hands. Your classmates remained silent. They helped &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; to get up. You heard someone muttering:
&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; will lose his balls today.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You turned around. The students apart from those of your class congratulated you on your victory. You knew it wasn&#39;t the end. You were fighting a lot through your school life and even if you won sometimes, it didn&#39;t solve anything.

You lost the balance for a moment, but this moment was enough for &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; to grab and throw you.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You managed to cover your head when he started to kick you.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;You bitch! You little shit! You faggot!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he screamed. &lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;I will teach you your place! You cunt! You fucker!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The pain was intense, but you didn&#39;t scream. Finally he calmed down.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Then he left. People around you were laughing and commenting. One of the older girls helped you get up. She smiled sadly.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Get up, little girl,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said. &lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;You showed some spirit, but better go back to your dolls.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Have you thought about it? You&#39;d make quite a tall girl, if &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; let you keep your height. And even if not, you are the one experienced with heels, not me.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

You wiped away  &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; smile. He was ashamed of his height and tried to hide it by wearing wedges. 

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Shut up, bitch!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he shouted. &lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;You won&#39;t be so talkative with a cock in your throat!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;At least I have to kneel to suck one!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you snapped back.

You learned that the key to winning such squabbles was to repeat insults similar to the first one that the audience liked. Nobody really liked &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. Jokes about his height were quite popular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;if $player.Flashy gte 3&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $directVictim = false&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, do you really know how to walk in heels?

That was the reaction you needed.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure he does. If he doesn&#39;t wear them, he would have to find a girlfriend shorter than him in the third grade.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;I told you to shut up!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

But &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; lost the initiative. The audience changed sides. Even your classmates that hated you started to leave. He muttered something indistinctly and left also.

You knew this park like the back of your hand. You ran to the ruins of the forts. Some  of them remained in the permanent renovation. You quickly jump over the fences. You didn&#39;t think your classmates were determined enough to chase you here, but you didn&#39;t want to risk it. You went under the scaffoldings and entered the fort. Despite the renovation, it was still stinking with mold and decay. You used to play here as a kid. You knew there was a corridor leading to the other side of the earthwork. Workers didn&#39;t close the door, they just hung the sign. 

You had a lot of time to think about &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; and...
[[...the Parity.|So, the Parity...]]

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Where the fuck do you think you&#39;re going, bitch?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he yelled. You realized that violence was the only solution.

It was one of the top schools in the city. It was quite a surprise for your teachers from middle school that both you and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; got there. But you did, and on the first of September you were there, waiting for the future: high school life.

The lists of students in every class hung on the door. It seemed strange to you that the older students crowded among them and laughed. In your class, there were four boys more than girls. Generally, in your year there were a lot of boys with good exam results. You listened to the introductory speech, where the principal said that it was a very masculine year. Some days later the speech changed itself and the principal didn&#39;t remember that he said something like that. Girls and boys in the &#39;&#39;Rosset High School&#39;&#39; were equal as always, regardless if anyone talked about the rights of students or their number. 

You didn&#39;t believe in stories about &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; and her hugs. But you believed when you saw the first transformations of people. The changes in the art class were the most drastic because there were twenty-four girls and only four boys. You saw with your own eyes how ten girls grew rapidly, their faces hardened and their screams of panic changed from high pitch to deeper, masculine cries. You didn&#39;t turn that day, but you learned that only students remember how they used to be. For the others: parents, teachers, and friends who didn&#39;t go to &#39;&#39;Rosset&#39;s&#39;&#39;, changed students appeared like they were born and raised this way.

&#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; liked equality. Alice Rosset sacrificed her life to the idea of equal rights for men and women. Apparently, her idea lost a lot in abstraction, and as a vengeful spirit &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; preferred the concrete. Every student had to claim the power of the Parity.

And here you were. You had to challenge the powers of &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39;. Today your life could be twisted in so many ways... What did you think about that?&lt;/p&gt;[[&quot;I will fight for my balls!&quot;|Fight for my balls]]

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You fuckers.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you hissed.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me? Anyone could be hugged. This fucking curse is out of control.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You heard what &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; said. It&#39;s a humbug...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, we have an expert!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you sneered. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;No offence, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, I won&#39;t bet my balls on your occult knowledge.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You laughed. Turning the matter into a joke cleared the air. 

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You know, I already have your number,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; one of your classmates said.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;So what?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you snapped back. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;ve got &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; number for two years.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I bet you did,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she muttered. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I am a sex beast, after all.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t you think that &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; could mess with my head?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, you asked.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Nah,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said flippantly. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I think you are just horny little bastard. You were watching porn constantly for two weeks, that&#39;s all.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;O boy, spare some details to the paywall users, ok?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she exclaimed. She looked rather shocked. But it was &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, so it couldn&#39;t last long. 

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said in very serious tone that absolutely didn&#39;t match to the mischievous sparkles in her eyes. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;As your professional therapist, I sincerely advise you to quit your drugs and porn.

And she started to laugh, of course. You sighed.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I think you should take this more seriously,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Of course, buddy,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she agreed quickly. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;What part?

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not joking,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure thing, dude,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he chuckled. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;d use my extensive Catholic education. You have to confess from your lucid dreaming. You committed disgusting sins, my brother.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She irritated you.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Come on, be serious. Don&#39;t you think &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; could mess with my head?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you asked.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; hesitated for a few seconds, then she shrugged. 

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;There are millions horny boys in this world,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said lightly, &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;and only one demonic bitch.

There was a plot against you and you couldn&#39;t do anything earlier, because &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, your best friend, decided to keep that news in secret! You weren&#39;t sure about &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;s&#39;&#39; taste. You heard the stories that very girly girls ended with dicks swinging between their legs and jocks that became the girlfriends of their teammates. 

You looked at &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; calm, even joyful face and felt how the anger was increasing in you in every second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Olivia&#39;s up to something&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I have a plan!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
[[You let her tell her plan.|She told you her plan]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;[[&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me?!&quot;|Yell at her!]] &lt;&lt;if $forcefulConversation ==0&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;forceful $display&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

You closed your fingers into a fist.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yup, &quot;&lt;/span&gt; she confirmed. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ve done my homework, you know. There is a way to communicate with &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; and if you do that, you can make a deal with her. Like, who would be transformed and in what way.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You stayed stunned. It was madness. But &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; didn&#39;t notice (or care). She continued confidently:

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, it was wild, when the news spread out. I mean, there are a lot of creeps who thought they could make their dream girlfriends. It was sick. Maybe you were lucky you were ill last week. Boys went psycho. But they couldn’t handle all these  occult things. They were too scared. I wasn&#39;t.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Have you... made this deal?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you asked quietly.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yup, sort of. It has two parts and the second one I can do only on the day of hugging. I&#39;ve ordered nothing kinky or cruel,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she reserved. She looked at you, evidently looking for a praise. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;However &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; would deserve it. He deserves to be an ugly chick, or extremely busted, as he wants to see all girls. That would be just. But no, he will just be a girl. That&#39;s enough.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You didn&#39;t want to think about this poetic justice. You already saw the &#39;&#39;Rosset High School&#39;&#39;, grimly contrasted among many younger buildings in the street. There were a lot of things you should talk about with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, but they had to wait.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The building of &#39;&#39;Rosset High School&#39;&#39; dominated the street. Old terraced houses, even those renovated, couldn&#39;t compare with the grim, stubby structure. The building looked like some monster that squatted next to the street. The monster with many eyes, you  thought about its high windows. You wouldn’t like it, even if you didn&#39;t know the truth about &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39;.

The bust of patroness was looking away  from the street, as always. Nobody grinned at you, no girl you knew wanted to strip you in front of the cheering crowd. However, the similarity of this place to the dream was overwhelming. It was like you came back after a few hours.

You observed the students that were passing you by. It was Spring, quite a warm day. Girls dressed in more revealing clothes. Still modest, of course, the dress-code in your school was strict. You couldn&#39;t help but think about what you would wear tomorrow. Would it be a shirt and hoodie, or maybe would it be a blouse or top? And what about the shoes? No, without exaggeration. Most girls wore sneakers. The mentioned strict dress-code also delayed the need to learn how to apply make-up. For the first time in your life, you were thankful that you lived in a conservative country.

When you passed by the bust you had an unpleasant feeling again. You looked up at the stone statue. &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; didn&#39;t have red eyes, her stone face didn&#39;t smile. Therefore, some kind of darkness was lurking in this granite face. You sighed.

You crossed the threshold of the school hall. You were curious if it was the last time you did it as a boy.&lt;/p&gt;[[The locker room.|The bra scene]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="46" name="Yell at her!" tags="" position="4807,284" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $relations.Olivia=$relations.Olivia-1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;

You turned into the inner street. 

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Are you completely out of your mind?!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you shouted. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Jesus Christ! I don&#39;t need enemies if I have friends like you! We spoke at least two times daily. Every fucking math you texted me! And now you&#39;re telling me that Auntie is about to go hunting down guys, and Carl persuaded everyone to set me up!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, calm down..&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t tell me to calm down! You have no right to tell me to calm down! You have no right to hide something like that from me! How dare you?!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Get your shit together, dude! And stop yelling at me. Nothing happened and nothing will happen...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Shut up! You don&#39;t know! You know nothing how &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; works...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Actually...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Have you sold me out? Would it be so much fun if I grow tits in front of everyone?!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She punched you. Hard. Her face darkened. 

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Shut your fucking mouth, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, before you say one more word out of line.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she hissed. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Or I kick your balls just to check you still have them. I would never betray you. Never. I owe you much, buddy, probably more than you owe me. And that you are upset and scared doesn&#39;t mean you should forget about that. You&#39;ll need me today. Don&#39;t push me away. You&#39;ll be fine. Trust me.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You both were angry. And you didn&#39;t have time for this.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you muttered. She rolled her eyes. You went quietly.&lt;/p&gt;[[So, the Parity...]]

Every student had an assigned locker. The first thing students had to do was to buy a padlock and put it on the unoccupied locker. Sometimes it wasn&#39;t enough to keep the locker. It was quite common that students (especially those unpopular) found their stuff laying on the floor and realized that they had to find another locker, except when they took a pincer and cut off the new padlock. The school staff didn&#39;t care.

Since there was no system of assignment, people from one class had lockers in the different parts of the locker-room. So, when you saw some of your classmates standing near your locker, you knew something was happening. Then you saw &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, who was looking at you maliciously.

&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Fight&quot;) and $player.Forceful gte 2 or visited(&quot;Fight&quot;) and $player.Conflicts gte 1&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Do you come for your next beating?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you snarled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, you&#39;d make me come today, babe!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he laughed. &lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;I wouldn’t mind a good tit-fuck, when you finally get your equipment.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $humiliation==1&gt;&gt;You passed him by silently. You wanted to avoid trouble in the locker-room, as you knew it was the last chance for &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; to torment you with impunity. The teachers could disregard most of the bullying happening in this school, but on a day like this you wouldn&#39;t despise any form of protection.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You looked back at him and calmly passed him by.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

You opened your locker and saw the foreign, fabric thing. A bra. You shuddered, but it wasn&#39;t just an unpleasant feeling that someone broke into your locker and breached your privacy. It was a tingling that went through your whole body.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Is &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; transforming me now?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you thought and held your breath. But no, nothing happened.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;You know, &lt;&lt;textbox &quot;$you.femaleName&quot; &quot;Pauline&quot;&gt;&gt;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; said. You shuddered again as you heard the feminine variant of your name. &lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;As you have a meeting with &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; today, we decided to make sure you&#39;d dress properly. You are such a reckless girl, and &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; is a lady, after all, and maybe won&#39;t like you flashing your tits.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

It was a lie, of course. &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; would be full of joy if the girls in this school were naked all the time. 

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Come on, put in on, babe!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; one of your classmates shouted and the rest of the guys started to encourage you.

You felt someone&#39;s hand on your shoulder. It was &lt;&lt;textbox &quot;$they.robertName&quot; &quot;Robert&quot;&gt;&gt;, the jock, the tallest and the most muscular boy in the whole school. You faced him. He was smiling. You had never seen such a creepy grin.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Go on, you&#39;ll love it,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. Even his voice was disturbing. His fingers gently stroked your shoulder and neck. &lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;I hope it will be your size.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

There was a tense situation. Everybody was laughing, but it was just a pose. Everyone knew the stakes. One of you had to become a girl, so focusing on the one was a logical solution. 

You decided to...&lt;/p&gt;[[...wear a bra.|Bra-Wear it willingly]]

You took &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; hand from your shoulder, but he still would have been too close if you had wanted to squeeze through your classmates. 

But you saw a way out. The locker you had was in the middle of the room, so it wasn&#39;t situated against the wall. Before anyone reacted, you had put your leg on the shelf, climbed on your locker, and jumped down to the next corridor. You ran quickly, pushing through the surprised students. You heard that your classmates decided to chase you. It was only one chance - got into the staff room. They wouldn&#39;t force you to wear a bra in front of the cleaner!

You looked over your shoulder. The boys were close, too close. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was at the front, and you realized that he was smiling like a madman. You kept running. A dozen meters more! You saw the cleaner. She was even looking in your direction! 

Then, you realized that something was wrong. The cleaner&#39;s eyes were glassy, she was swaying like in a trance. Definitely, &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; decided to interfere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $approaches.contains(2) and $approaches.contains(5) or $clockMystery ==true&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $clockChange = true&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;//You didn&#39;t have much time to look closely at her, but you noticed that she seemed to vibrate in some repetitive rhythm.//&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $approaches.contains(5) or $directVictim == false&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You passed the cleaner and ran on the stair.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;[[Small-talk.|Olivia talks about the scene]]&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then you felt a heavy hand that grabbed your arm. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; pushed you against the wall. You hit it hard. Then, he grasped your neck. You started to choke. The classmates gathered around you again. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; brought the bra.

You&#39;d never fought against &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; and you hoped it would stay that way. He usually avoided fights, his posture was enough of a threat. You even considered &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; as a good guy, so his part in this plot was a sad surprise. On the other hand, you had heard a story about a football player who was hugged by &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; two years ago. The guy used to be about &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; size and ended as a petite girl, which surely changed his life drastically. Still, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; enthusiasm scared you.

You forced yourself to laugh. You took the bra. You didn&#39;t really know much about the sizes, but it appeared that it would be lingerie for a really busty girl. It was black and lacy. In fact, it was very similar to the bra that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; wore in your dream.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Wow, guys, such classy lingerie,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I didn&#39;t know you have such good taste. I bet you spent a lot of time in the mall choosing it. Your boyfriends had to be exhausted waiting for you to finish shopping!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; looked at you disappointed.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Let it go, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. &lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Everything is settled.

You ripped the bra out of his hands. The soft fabric felt nice, even too nice. You looked at it with a disgust that you didn&#39;t share with many boys your age.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Fuck you, man!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you snorted. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe you&#39;ll become a girl, after all. I wouldn&#39;t give up my balls while I have them.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He looked at you with some respect. Damn, that was the whole problem with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. He wasn&#39;t a bad guy.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;I like your spirit,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he answered. &lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;I hope you&#39;ll keep this fire. It&#39;s a rough world for girls, after all.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You winced.&lt;/p&gt;[[Then you threw the bra away.|Just throw it away]]&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $directVictim ==true or visited(&quot;They think it is not funny&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then he grabbed you. You struggled, but it wasn&#39;t a fight you could win. He easily pressed you against the wall with one hand! His fingers tightened on your throat. You started to choke. You started to kick and punch, but it was clear you achieved nothing. The pain was horrible. 

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Will you wear a bra, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; asked calmly.

You still were grasping the air, but you nodded. He was a psycho, for sure.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Good girl. What&#39;s your name?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You looked at him with pure hate, but his hand was clenching again on your neck, so you said quickly:

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; smiled and patted your cheek. He released you.&lt;/p&gt;[[And gave you a bra.|Made you wear it]]
&lt;&lt;elseif $directVictim ==false&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; stood up. Everyone could see tears in his eyes. Red in the face, with a bleeding nose he didn&#39;t look like a guy who was controlling the situation. 

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Your makeup smudged, babe,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you sneered. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe you better go to the girls&#39; restroom before you&#39;ll go to the classroom? We somehow explain your absence, don&#39;t worry.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Your classmates laughed, somehow nervously. The plan to get you hugged by &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; clearly collapsed. It was a relief that not everybody felt it was right to set you up, but it was a risk for them too.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You forgot to put your bra on, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said mercilessly. Your classmates laughed once more. Even &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; grinned, but it was a creepy smile.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Put this on,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he demanded as he put the bra in &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; hands. &lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;We don&#39;t want sluts in our schools.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Well, tables turned. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; knew that begging or fighting wouldn&#39;t help him, so he started to take off his hoodie.
&lt;/p&gt;[[He wore a bra.|Make him wear it]]&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="52" name="Made you wear it" tags="" position="5967,924" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count=$count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $braWear=true&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;defiance $auntie&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You felt that tears of humiliation were coming down from your eyes. You took your shirt and t-shirt off. You faced them bare-chested. Did your nipples jutt out more than usual or it was just your imagination?

The bra was soft and nice to touch. Your fingers were trembling, so putting it on took you a while, but finally, you put your arms down and everyone could see you in the feminine lingerie. There were some comments and laughs, but your classmates were surprisingly serious. Some of them moved along, as they were sure you&#39;d put the bra on. Apparently, they had some compassion.

Of course, not everyone. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was triumphant. 

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;I knew you are one of these bitches that think &quot;yes&quot; even when they say &quot;no&quot;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. &lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;I bet you&#39;ll repeat that about anal. Not that we&#39;ll do it today. Today we&#39;ll test your new hole.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was smiling at you. The empty cups definitely stimulated his imagination. But when he heard what &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; said, his face hardened. He grabbed him strongly.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t try to be too funny, dude,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he snarled. &lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;And don&#39;t speak to &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; like that.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; hissed because of pain and surprise. He managed to break away from &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; grasp.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;What the hell, man?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he exclaimed. But he didn&#39;t dare to confront the jock. He shrugged. &lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Whatever. Have fun with her.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

And he left quickly. He was apparently afraid of &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; and you couldn&#39;t blame him. When the jock looked at you again, you felt fear too. You stood just a meter from him, undressed to the waist, with a black, lacy bra on your chest. You felt weak and small compared to him. And his dreamy grin made you feel sick.&lt;/p&gt;[[Then he drew you towards him.|Robert grabs you]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="53" name="Make him wear it" tags="" position="5964,1043" size="100,100">&lt;p&gt;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was a skinny and short guy. He looked even weaker when he was surrounded by taller boys. He looked at the floor, carefully avoiding your gazes. When he took off his t-shirt you couldn&#39;t help but smile widely. The bare-chested, thin guy was going to wear the bra he wanted to use to humiliate you. The fucker. You had never done anything against him. Now it was time for him to taste his own medicine.

When &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; wore a bra, you felt a wave of nearly sexual pleasure tingling through your body. He looked ridiculous, of course, with those empty cups. But it was you who decided how he had to act. You influenced his behavior. And you knew you could force him again, again and again. 

Your classmates took photos of him. You knew that if &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; transformed, they&#39;d changed into the photo of the girl he&#39;d become wearing just this bra. So you were grinning maliciously, thinking about the power you just showed to everyone.

You blinked. You felt dizzy for a moment. You stepped back. You realized that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;...&lt;/p&gt;[[...was looking at you with a very similar, malicious grin.|Robert&#39;s creep]]

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Fuck you, faggot!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; took the business personally. With his fists clenched, he evidently wanted to...

You weren&#39;t a girl (yet, at least), the idea of sexual harassment was an abstract term to you. However, as you felt horrified and paralyzed, you recognized the stories about molested women. Damn, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was frightening and definitely pleased with your behavior.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t worry about &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. &lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Since today, no one will dare to bother you.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Wonderful. Except him, you guess. But you were too stunned to respond.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, he said mildly. His tone compared to his behavior scared you even more. &lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Everything will be alright. Everything is settled. You&#39;ll be happy, I promise. Put a shirt on, you&#39;ll get cold.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

His care and sympathy sounded genuine, but it only increased the absurdity of this situation. In fact, you felt cold. You got goosebumps, but you suspect it wasn&#39;t because of the temperature.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; stroked your cheek.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;You shouldn&#39;t take off the bra,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. &lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Get used to it. I&#39;ll catch you later.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You stepped back to your locker. You breathed heavily and you wanted to vomit. Would &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; check if you took the bra off? You imagined how he put his muscular hand under your shirt. 

Did you keep the bra on you?&lt;/p&gt;[[Yes.|Keep it]]

You felt relief. There was something in throwing away this bra, something... cleansing. You got rid of the tension the dream introduced. Even if &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; chose you to hug and your life changed dramatically today, in this short moment you felt independent and strong. 

The locker-room was crowded. You were jealous about the students of the other classes. They didn&#39;t have to face the Parity today. You suspected the rumors had spread, so they knew about the hugging, but it was an attraction to them.

He stared at you the whole time. While the crowd was laughing at &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, who ran away with his clothes in his hands to the nearest restroom, the jock got closer to you.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s fine feeling, isn&#39;t it?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Bigger than mine&quot;)&gt;&gt;//He reminded you of the &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; from your dream.

He rolled his eyes, but that gesture was so theatrical that you didn&#39;t believe he was upset or surprised because of your question. Then he sighed, which looked inauthentic too.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Soon you&#39;ll be unable to lie to me, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. &lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;I will be the closest man in your life. Then, you&#39;ll compare the feelings, since &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; gives different... sensations to men and women.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You froze. You thought that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was the author of the plot against you. It looked like you underestimated &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I think your future girlfriend just ran away,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you tried to joke. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;And she doesn&#39;t like the lingerie you bought her.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

His grimace didn&#39;t change.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;I know you enjoyed forcing him to do what you want, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he answered.

Sluttier. &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; assured me of that, and I have to tell you... I barely can wait.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He left. You felt unsettled. Your joy of triumph vanished. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; sounded very sure, and he wasn&#39;t really a good liar. You bit your lip so hard you felt the blood. Damn.

So, it was going to be a calm lesson. That was a strange thought.

You sat in your usual place, next to &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. You didn&#39;t miss this classroom at all. You wouldn&#39;t mind if today started with a less stressful lesson. You had some business to handle.

Your teacher started the lesson. Fortunately, even this old hag wouldn’t make anyone come up to the blackboard on their first day after an absence. Tomorrow you probably  wouldn&#39;t have such luck.

Maybe she was a mythological creature after all.

And you were sure no girl would do so. He wasn&#39;t a flashy kid at all. But, in contrast to all of you terrified freshmen, he crossed a threshold of &#39;&#39;Rosset High School&#39;&#39; with full awareness of what the Parity was and he wanted to use it. 

On the second day of school &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was only a newly transformed girl who seemed happy about her change.

So you sank into the sight of her lovely...
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You tried very hard, but you couldn&#39;t take your eyes off her. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; had to be aware of your struggle, because she looked directly at you and flashed you a smile. You felt like you were melting. 

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s ok to peek,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she assured you. The timbre of her lovely voice finally broke your resistance.

She usually grinned in the way you would expect on the Cheshire Cat, if he was a schoolgirl from cursed high school. She didn&#39;t care much about her clothing. You probably never saw her in a skirt since kindergarten. She usually wore combat pants, as she held nearly everything in the pockets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;She yawned again.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Are you not entertained?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you sneered.

She shrugged. She pretended she checked the clock.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I think I lost my program. When will they release the lions, Maximus?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Before you could find suitable reference to &quot;Gladiator&quot;, your math teacher said:

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, I told you not to sit next to &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Really?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; looked genuinely surprised. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;But it’s his first day back in school!

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, so you’ve learned so well you could help someone? Incredible. Let&#39;s not waste such a situation. It doesn&#39;t happen every day. Come on, the blackboard is waiting.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; sighed dramatically.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I told you, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she exclaimed. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Innocent people always suffer.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

The old hag scoffed.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;You? Innocent? Since when?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; pulled a face.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;No one believes in me!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She was good at math, so she quickly came back. Your teacher of course didn&#39;t remind her not to sit next to you. It was just a ritual that had repeated itself since your freshman year.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;So, what do you think?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, she asked you.

You looked at &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. He was the biggest surprise of this day. Ok, he was a jock with rather limited interests, but you knew him as a good guy. His dreamy gazes made you sick. Even now you had to turn around. He clearly expected that &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; would hug you at any moment and he could barely wait. It was disgusting.

On the other hand, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was no surprise.

He had some trouble with the law, he was helping the local drug dealers. Maybe he was smart enough to avoid jail for a while, but you didn&#39;t see a bright future for him.

There was a lot of tension between you and the boys in your class. You wondered if tomorrow you&#39;d be a girl. How would your life change?

Such a loser like &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; had the life of a goddess now. He saw her precious &lt;&lt;print $envy0&gt;&gt; in the mirror every day.

He wasn&#39;t. He was an impostor. He was a fraud.

You&#39;d pay a lot of money to see her naked, but even more to have the opportunity to strip her, alone. Especially, if she would want it. You wanted her to be happy. Such an angel deserved it.

You knew &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; was angry at you. You felt her wrath, but you didn&#39;t care. You were a normal guy, it was completely natural that she attracted you. You even allowed yourself  longer to peek at her &lt;&lt;print $envy&gt;&gt; just to irritate &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; more.

Then the bell rang. You realized that you were...&lt;/p&gt;[[...really tired.|The bell]]

You didn&#39;t see it, but it was something you envied the most. The delicate lips, the sensitive clitoris and the tight slit. You were rock hard, every single thought gave you a blast of orgasmic pleasure, but still, you were ashamed that you had a penis, when you could have a pussy like &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.

Damn, why had &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; waited so long? You wanted to be a girl. You wanted it so desperately that you wanted to howl. It was a desire you had never felt in your whole life. You would do everything for it. Give everything. Why did this damn statue wait so long? Did she want to make you beg? You would beg! You&#39;d pray for the chance! You&#39;d be the best girl ever transformed during the history of this school!

And then the bell rang. You blinked several times. You were sweating like hell. You felt terribly thirsty. You realized that your hands were shaking. You felt weak and dizzy. 

What the fuck was that?&lt;/p&gt;[[The bell rang.|The bell]]

You breathed deeply. That was a very exhausting experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students were leaving the classroom, so you also started to pack your stuff. It wasn&#39;t easy. You dropped a pencil several times, you just couldn&#39;t catch it properly. 

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, are you ok?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;  You heard this sweet voice and jumped. It was &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, who looked at you with serious concern. You blushed furiously.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure he is!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; said. She took your books and notebooks and threw them quickly into your backpack. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Get up, bro. We already spent longer in this dungeon than we should!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;I heard that!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; your teacher said. You had to look really bad, because she added: &lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe you came to school too early, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. Girls, could you close the door? I&#39;ll leave you a key.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

And then she left, minding her harpy&#39;s business. 

You tried to get up quickly, but you staggered. You would have fallen, if &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; didn&#39;t catch you. You realized that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was observing you carefully. &lt;&lt;if $approaches.contains(1) or $approaches.contains(2)&gt;&gt;//She clearly was calmed by this observation, because she relaxed and even smiled a little.//&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; just sniffed you,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Drink some water.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; snorted. 

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Listen to the expert, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, she said. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; probably often sticks her nose in your ass, doesn&#39;t she? She probably smells many dicks there. Do you have any more advice for him, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;? There is something we missed?&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; smile became cold. 

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;What&#39;s your problem... this time, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You are my problem, bitch. So fuck off before I break something of yours.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; looked like she wanted to snap back, but she just shrugged and left. &lt;&lt;if $approaches.contains(1) or $approaches.contains(2)&gt;&gt;//You saw that before she left, she made a quick gesture and waited for a moment.//&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;What happened?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you managed to ask.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;She spread out the method to communicate with &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39;.

You expected a joke or mockery, but &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; decided to treat the question seriously. She smiled.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I made a deal with &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You were shocked. You waited for her laughter. You wanted to hear you fell for another story, that you were naive. But she was serious and even a little resigned.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It seems I don&#39;t get to go to Heaven.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

There was sarcasm in her voice, but you knew this was a problem for her. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was raised in a very religious, Catholic family and, just like most rebel children with such a background, she was the most anti-clerical person you’d met in your life. But some beliefs stuck deep in her. &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39;, living proof of the supernatural, made &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; think about the catechism.

You cared far less  about Catholic statements on occultism, but you knew that parlay with &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; was too dangerous to try. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; showed courage (and recklessness). 

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;If you make a deal with &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39;, she&#39;ll hug whoever you want,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she explained. Her voice was calm, but you knew her too well. She was concerned. 

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;What... What price?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you asked.

She shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;A little blood. Of course, we’ll see where it leads. But &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; seems to be fine.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She shrugged again.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe you should... You know... Reconsider...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She shook her head.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Too late.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; She sighed. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, can we talk about something else? Pretty please.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Well, however you understood her aversion, you had the right to your questions, and a plot against you was in session. So you asked:

You realized that was quite likely. There were rumors that some school places were more cursed than others. However no one pointed to the math classroom, but maybe it was because of the fact that one horror - the old hag - covered the other that was only awake temporarily. 

That conclusion cheered you up a little. If business with &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; went wild you weren&#39;t totally hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;[[The lesson went on.|The lesson scene]]

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; the shortest guy in the class. He&#39;s afraid he&#39;s destined to sit on the bench for the busty team. Most of the boys who were hugged on the first day weren&#39;t giants, you know. But you know it&#39;s not a rule. Some 16-year-old guys are short just because hormones haven&#39;t kicked them yet. Of course, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; won&#39;t grow much. Too many cigarettes.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

The last sentence she said slyly. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was nearly your height and she started to smoke at the age of twelve. 

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You were absent and they &lt;&lt;if $relations.Boys lte 2&gt;&gt;don&#39;t like you&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;like their dicks more than you&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;.

You sighed.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; wants me badly. He keeps calling me &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; and he&#39;s such a creep... He acts like he&#39;s high.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

In fact, she had her own rhythm. She even was beating it with her foot. You were really concerned before you heard that she was quietly singing Tom Waits&#39; &quot;Singapore&quot;.

You stood on the chair. You could tell that cleaners didn&#39;t bother doing so. The clock was really dusty.

You wondered how to break the clock imperceptibly. You had no tools. You decided that you&#39;d remove several cogwheels that connected the mechanism with the mainspring. You used your keys to pry a sprocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;if $approaches.contains(1) and $approaches.contains(6) or $approaches.contains(2) and $approaches.contains(5)&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckilly, you realized that the pendulum was going to fall.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was looking at you with interest.
&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You are a skilled rogue, indeed. Can we get coffee now?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;[[School day|PE]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You immediately realized that you had made a mistake, but it was too late. The pendulum fell out with a terrible noise. You had to dodge because it could break your leg. You hit the clock with your head. It hit the ground, smashing into many pieces.

The old hag ran into the classroom. There was no sense in denying it - you were standing on the chair with a pendulum in your hand.&lt;/p&gt;[[She sent you to the principal&#39;s office.|To the principal&#39;s office!]]&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="84" name="Not now..." tags="" position="7681,636" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count=$count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;lossDefiance $auntie&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $clockDestroy =1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;&lt;if $possibilityClock==false&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Not now...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, whatever you want,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You look tired, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. I’ll buy you coffee, ok?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You nodded. You didn&#39;t think you needed caffeine, but it was useless to be in this classroom. &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; defeated you. This clock only made you feel worse.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You hesitated. Breaking the clock was like declaring war against &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39;. You weren&#39;t sure you wanted this.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Fuck this shit!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you exclaimed. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Lets go!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

After the initial shock, you had to admit that the plot against you appeared to be less prepared than you thought.

Then, there was the last lesson. PE. Until now, you had &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; support, but here you had to face the bullies alone.

Luckily, you didn&#39;t have to exercise. You had sick leave for the next two weeks. When you said it to &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; heard it too.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s good you take yoga seriously,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said back. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;The pose of the Mountain can give you an inch or more in your height, &lt;&lt;textbox &quot;$they.carlFemaleName&quot; &quot;Caroline&quot;&gt;&gt;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

His face turned pale for a moment, then darkened. If &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was right about &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;s&#39;&#39; sniffs, that was the moment for &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. He spit into your face and left. Angrily, you wanted to pounce on him, but &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; stopped you. 

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;That could be the last time that&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; spat!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she yelled and everyone laughed.

The bell rang and the girls all went to their lockers. 

&lt;&lt;if $directVictim==true&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You should go with them!&quot;,&lt;/span&gt; one of your classmates shouted.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;If you don&#39;t feel well, you shouldn&#39;t play, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; said quietly. He stood next to you, towering over you completely.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Haven&#39;t you realized that I&#39;m not a girl?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you asked with disgust. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s sick when you treat me like one.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He shrugged. His muscles moved under his t-shirt.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;In one hour it won’t be odd,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he answered. He gave you another one of his creepy grins. &lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

And he left. Boys started to go to their lockers. The game was some sort of a challenge. You knew you&#39;d be playing soccer, so the girls wouldn&#39;t play with you. So, if you didn&#39;t play, you&#39;d be separate from the other boys. Maybe &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; would consider this?

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; clearly wanted to add something, but he looked at &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; and said nothing. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, your prince charming, your defender.

You could feel the tension. When your coach came and announced the soccer game, the boys reacted like he chose the weapon during the gladiators&#39; fight. You ran to the playing field.

His fall from grace was a sight to see.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; The coach whistled and the match started.

That was probably the most brutal game you ever played. Every critical situation ended with a quarrel and shouts, some with a fight. The couch was whistling constantly, but without vivid effect.

It didn&#39;t matter. It was war. The members of the opposite team were targets. The one with the ball was conspicuous, but the others, if they were close, were getting hit also. After over a dozen minutes every player was more or less battered.

The game established a hierarchy in a very primitive sense. If someone was afraid of you, if someone backed off, it meant you dominated him. Of course, in such a herd, only &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; could be alpha. Facing him was like challenging the avalanche. Your classmates didn&#39;t want to commit suicide, so they focused on other players.

You observed &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. He had a great time. You realized he was the only guy today who acted like the Parity didn&#39;t bother him. His manhood was indisputable. How could it not be? He wasn&#39;t really a type of occultist.

When you were looking at him you noticed that he was squeezing his left hand. He definitely tried to protect it while engaging in violent situations. That was strange. There was a short moment he loosened his hand up. You saw the scar on his palm. 

You had to stop your observation. When &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; took over the ball, four players from the other team charged him. He yelled (or even squeaked) and kicked the ball out of the bounds in a panic, but they didn&#39;t care. Two boys didn&#39;t even start to slow. They hit him hard. &lt;/p&gt;[[He fell on the ground.|They faul Carl]]

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Holy fuck! She hugged him!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; one of your classmates shouted. Guys surrounded &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, so you couldn&#39;t see.

You stood up and came closer. Guys let you through. Well, you earned the privilege to look at &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. &lt;/p&gt;[[There she was.|Carl looks like a girl]]

It was a really high-pitched squeak, which sobered you quickly. You raised your head to look at the rest of your body. Your stare stopped at two mounds of flesh on your chest. Strands of long hair lay on your face. Shit. It happened.

The crowd thickened around you. Boys gazed at you with a mix of fascination and relief. Well, they kept their balls, you didn&#39;t. 

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Lie down, get used to this position!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; exclaimed. You saw his face above you, smiling cruelly. Yeah, you also had to get used to this bullying.

Nobody helped you to get up. They even stepped back as you were infected with something contagious. Your back was aching. Finally, you stood up and shook off the dust.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;What the fuck?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You looked around. Everyone stared at you, shocked. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; had a rather comic grimace of disbelief on his face. You looked at yourself quickly and gasped. You were a boy again! You even checked your groin and convinced yourself that everything was in the right place.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;How did you do that?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; asked. There was fear in his voice. 

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I am a fucking Avenger,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you scoffed and smirked. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Evidently, &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; decided to hug one of you fuckers.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Your classmates exchanged glances. It was the last lesson, so it was in just a matter of minutes that the transformation would occur. 

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hey, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, everything all right?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; the coach asked.

You gave him a thumbs-up and laughed.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Never better, coach.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Great! Get back to the game!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he exclaimed and whistled. 

You grinned to &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. He murmured something, but you couldn&#39;t hear what exactly.

And then &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; appeared. He looked like a sleepwalker. 

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;I knew you&#39;d make a beautiful girl,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said slyly, and, before you could react...&lt;/p&gt;[[...he leaned and kissed you!|Robert kisses you]]

He was crushing you in his strong arms. You could barely breathe. You thought he would break your ribs. You felt his erect penis rubbing you. You were full of disgust and terror.

Finally, he stopped. Your face was covered by his saliva. He didn&#39;t let you go, he still was pressing you with one hand. He used the other hand to stroke your hair.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;I knew you would be gorgeous,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. &lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;You are just like my dream. You are just like I ordered... Will your soul be as ideal as your body? It should be... It has to be! I paid for it... I deserve to have it...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

There was nothing sane in his desperate voice, but the meaning was clear for you. If there was anybody who set you up for &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39;, it was &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, who wanted to get a girl magically, as he had no luck with real ones. You thought that if you were a girl, you definitely wouldn&#39;t want to deal with him. But, his words made you realize that your will could be changed.

Everything you feared about the transformation faded in comparison to such a fate. You wanted to scream. You wanted to fight. You wanted to run.&lt;/p&gt;[[The break.|Girls&#39; restroom]]&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $robertPlans = true&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure. See ya later.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
She left. You came back to the field. It looked like &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was fouled. Then you heard:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, shit! Look, guys!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

A thin, petite girl sat  on the graveled field. Short, but with an evidently feminine hair-cut, small breasts, and a delicate face. Big eyes widened by the terror. 

Your classmates didn&#39;t laugh. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; looked disappointed. Surely, he expected you to be hugged. You all were shocked by the suddenness of this transformation. You had witnessed some huggings. They always lasted a while. It was one thing to get used to the gender transformations in your school. It was something different to observe that &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; had changed her methods. Did sudden transformation mean that your patroness was stronger? 

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, are you ok?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; coach asked. Of course, he didn&#39;t notice. The Parity worked that way. 

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;I suppose, coach.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; the petite girl answered quietly, evidently scared of how girly her voice sounded. She didn&#39;t look like an eighteen year old young woman. You knew more mature fifteen-year-old girls. 

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Great! Get up! We have fifteen minutes left. And, gentlemen, please. Fifteen minutes of a good game, ok?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

The new girl in your class stood up without help. She stood... and she became &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; again. The change was instant. You always thought that the phrase &quot;rub your eyes&quot; was just a metaphor, but some guys literally did it. When &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; found out that he was a boy again, he looked like he was going to faint.  
&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; looked at you, evidently happy.

She told the secretary what you did The old woman could be in the same witch coven with your Math teacher. You were told to sit in the waiting room.

You didn&#39;t worry. The principal&#39;s office was a threat to elementary school kids. And your principal used his position only for self-promotion. You didn&#39;t suspect he would be in the pedagogical mood.

The waiting room was small. Two armchairs, a little table, and a cupboard. You looked at the flyers lying on the table. Most of them advertised colleges, the others were left by local politicians. You realized that the local elections would be in September. Your mother was a councilor in your district. You sighed. She would take half of your summer holidays away. Another problem to solve.

Then you noticed a piece of paper. It was printed from a computer and edited badly. You read the heading. 

&quot;&#39;&#39;Let&#39;s decommunize our city!&#39;&#39;&quot; There was a list of people who the author claimed wereCommunists and who remained the patrons of streets and institutions. You saw &#39;&#39;Alice Rosset&#39;&#39; on this list. You smirked. That would be very interesting, &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; with the Parity would haunt some old warehouse.

You heard the raised voice behind the door. Suddenly, the door opened. The man who was leaving the office could be the author of this heading. Bald, unshaven, and messy. 

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I will report you!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; the bald man exclaimed. The principal stood in the door. He was outraged. 

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Have a nice day, sir.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he answered.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You better start packing! We are coming for you! Fucking commies!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

The bald man left quickly. The principal lit a cigarette. The secretary looked at him with disapproval.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Get off me, &#39;&#39;Susan&#39;&#39;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Students smoke in toilets, teachers smoke in closets, at least I can smoke in my own office!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; He muttered something which had to be a swear word. Then he noticed you. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;What&#39;s your crime, son?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You stood up.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;He broke a clock in the math class, sir.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; the secretary answered.

The principal was visibly relaxed. Well, breaking a clock couldn&#39;t be the topic for newspapers.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Nothing more?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he asked. 

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sir!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

He shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Ok, ok. I give up. Why did you do it, son?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You thought about your answer.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Its ticking distracted me. Those lessons are stressful...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He interrupted you.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You see, &#39;&#39;Susan&#39;&#39;? The ticking was distracting. Those kids, snowflakes. Next time something distracts you, young man, report it. Ok? We are here to help.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Of course, sir. I promise. I am sorry.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure you are. Now go and let me work.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You left. Well, it went easier than you thought.

You met &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; in the corridor. She waited for you.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;So what? You gonna suck the old men&#39;s dicks to buy a new clock?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she asked.

You shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;They don&#39;t give a shit about the clock.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Great! Let’s break something else!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

It was your last lesson. &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;s&#39;&#39; behavior was strange. You didn&#39;t remember if anyone told you that she&#39;d ever waited to hug someone for so long. 

The boys were on the edges of their seats. They knew someone would be transformed. Some of them started to sneak out. They thought that they would be safe if they escaped from school. You knew that &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; didn&#39;t care about the place. Some students were transformed at school.

When you were walking the corridor, suddenly &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; pushed you against the wall. Then he grabbed you and started dragging you to the girls&#39; restroom. No word was spoken. You were grappling in silence.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I jumped myself.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you squeezed through your teeth.

He had to have seen something in the reflection, because he quickly looked away.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

The mirror was heavy. You&#39;d swear it was getting heavier every second. Your fingers went numb. You walked three or four steps and you felt incredible tiredness. You were sweating, you started to pant.

Finally, you reached the window. The mirror seemed to weigh tens of kilograms. You had to hold it with your knee because you needed one hand to open the window, which was stuck.

&lt;&lt;if $approaches.contains(4) or $approaches.contains(5)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $mirrorBreak =true&gt;&gt;You struggled with the handle for a while. At last,it let go.

You smiled triumphantly.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You struggled with the handle for a while. It was hopeless. You graned. Then you started to cry. You went through all your humiliations and fears, but this window defeated you. The mirror fell out of your stiff hands, but it didn&#39;t break, it just clinked when hit the floor. You leaned against the window.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $directVictim==true&gt;&gt;Suddenly, the door opened. To your surprise, you saw &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; running into the restroom.

You slowly got closer to the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girl in the mirror could be your twin sister. Well, your good looking twin sister. She had your blue eyes and dirty-blond hair, however, it was a little lighter. You could see some resemblance in the shape of her nose and lips, but they were much more delicate than yours. You couldn&#39;t help but look lower. The mirror was small, so you stood on tiptoe. Her breasts were average size, probably between B and C cups.

Her breasts. Your breasts.

It wasn&#39;t some girl in the mirror. It wasn&#39;t even some &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. It was you. You, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.

You went into the semi-trance. You were cute. You weren&#39;t in &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; class, but you didn&#39;t look bad. Not a bombshell, not a bimbo. Maybe a little nerdy, but not in the way that would convict you for a lifetime in the basement. You smiled a little. Damn, you had a nice smile.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;My name is &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you announced. 

And then your reflection smiled wryly and shook her head. You jumped, shocked. The girl in the mirror mouthed a few words, slowly, one syllable at a time. 

Not. Yet. But. Soon.

&lt;&lt;if $directVictim==true&gt;&gt;She motioned for you to step back. The door opened suddenly. You heard the laughter of the boys. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; ran into the restroom. He was terrified. You recognized that kind of terror.

He cringed as if he&#39;d been struck. He groaned.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;No, no, no... Please, no...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

But the changes had already started. You saw how the chest under his hoodie swelled. The breasts he was gaining now weren&#39;t big, but, with how slim and short he was, he clearly was becoming a rather small, delicate girl. He bit his lips. He wanted to straighten up, but another wave of pain struck him and he fell on the floor. He pressed his slender hands to his stomach. His yells were becoming more high-pitched every second. His hair grew, wriggling around his head. Finally, he had a rather short, feminine hair-cut. His face softened. You couldn&#39;t really notice the other changes as &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; hoodie became very loose. But after a moment you were sure that he became the girl in every part that  mattered. 

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, well, well. What do we have here?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;&lt;if not visited(&quot;Carl transforms during the break&quot;)&gt;&gt;You recognized this mischievous voice. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; passed you by. &lt;&lt;if not visited(&quot;Carl transforms during the break&quot;)&gt;&gt;You noticed she was paler than usual, and she had bandaged her left hand.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; She leaned over &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;PE&quot;)&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;textbox &quot;$they.carlFemaleName&quot; &quot;Caroline&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she exclaimed in very accurate parody of the girly-girl tone. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Looking good, girlfriend!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; opened her eyes. She was breathing heavily, nearly panting.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Fuck... Fuck off.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; smiled slyly as she heard that high, girly voice.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Wow, her first words! I have to admit, girl, you have a sense of style! Do you want me to help you, or would you rather just lay here?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she asked innocently.

The new girl tried to get up on her own, but she was too weak. Eventually, she accepted the waiting hand and finally stood up. She leaned against the wall. She looked really tired.

But for &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; it was like an additional Christmas. She commented on everything mercilessly: the nails, the eye-lashes, the hair-cut...

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I can&#39;t wait to see your outfit... Ooooh, it&#39;s happening!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

The last part of the transformation was usually a change of clothes. When &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; hoodie transformed into the rather revealing top and the t-shirt became a bra, you could notice the changes. The new girl was short and slim, just like &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was. Her breasts were small but proportional. She had some curves, but you were sure she&#39;d be asked about her ID in the next ten years if she wanted to buy cigarettes. 

Then, the trousers started to change. You couldn&#39;t say what cloth they&#39;d become, but &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; laughter explained everything.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, my God! The skirt!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

And a quite short one, you had to admit. 

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Stop... Stop it, please...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

There she was. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. A small girl with tears in her eyes. You...&lt;/p&gt;[[...joined in bullying her.|Laugh at him]]

I demand a burger for my hard work! I saved your balls, buddy. L i t e r a l l y.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She was grinning widely in the whole way. She was evidently curious how &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; would spend her first day as a girl.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s said that after &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;s&#39;&#39; hug you are horny as hell. I wonder what she&#39;ll stick in her new cunt first!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She laughed loudly, ignoring entirely all the damning stares from passers-by. You wondered if someone would report her to the police. She behaved like she was high.  

Last year the city council organized a food truck area near your school. Four food trucks were serving different menus. The area was dedicated to tourists, but you barely see any there. It was an area completely dominated by high school students, at least until late evenings. Even now, on Monday afternoon, you saw some familiar faces. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; wanted to share the happy news, but there were some students from other schools, so she couldn&#39;t say a word without being considered crazy (or, better to say, crazier). It upset her a bit.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Fuck off, losers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, she said as some people greeted us. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;We are on a date, we want privacy!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

There was a lot of laughter and cheering, some sarcastic compliments. Of course, they didn&#39;t believe it. You would barely believe either that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; could have a boyfriend. &lt;&lt;if $player.Popularity==0&gt;&gt;Or that you could get a girlfriend.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; But well, it worked, you found a table and no one sat with you.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Get me one with extra bacon, d a r l i n g&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, she said mockingly. You rolled your eyes. There was no sense in trying to argue in her current state. So you sighed and ordered a meal.

When you came back, you saw that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; looked at her bandaged hand. It was soaked with blood. Some of the blood dripped on the ground. It sobered her up a little.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Who&#39;d have known that occultism is so messy,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she murmured. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;But it was worth it, don&#39;t you think?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;[[&quot;My balls for your soul, fine deal to me&quot;]]

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Shame we don&#39;t have spurs.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you noticed.

She chuckled.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, this scene would totally be filmed by Sergio Leone.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Grim faces...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Then you both hummed the theme of &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; at the same time and laughed.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Have you prepared the line?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you asked.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;The line?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, the one-liner you&#39;d say at the start of the transformation.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Nah. Why bother.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You didn&#39;t believe her. You rolled your eyes.

You had to admit, it was a very good Pennywise imitation. 

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; pushed her away.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Fuck off, idiot!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he exclaimed.

Before you went to sleep and began this meaningful dream, you took a shower. Hot water refreshed you a bit. You were out of school for two weeks. It was a lot for an eighteen-year-old guy. It was a surprise that high school life, which seemed to be made of terribly boring things and it was awfully repetitive and predictable, suddenly sped up when you caught this flu. So you were thinking about tomorrow. And you were thinking about your life. It was late April, and after summer you would start a senior year in &#39;&#39;Rosset High School&#39;&#39;.

How was your life? This thought reminded you about the useless test you had to complete for the school psychologist. You remembered the first of many pages of questions about you, your good traits, the &quot;areas of the competence&quot; and all that coaching bullshit. It totally would help you start your adult life... Yet, you remembered what you chose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The teenagers around the world chose those 5 aspects of life as crucial to achieve satisfaction. Assign the number that describes you best. 0 - you don&#39;t feel you have achieved much in that aspect, 1 - you have some achievements in that aspect 2 - you achieved much in that sphere. Add a comment, where you describe what helps you succeed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;New character&quot;) ==1&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;hintboxOwn&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;&#39;The Parity&#39;&#39; is an RPG game. As many games of this genre, there are stats that describe your character and his (soon her) possibilities. Some stats are public - like &#39;&#39;Approaches&#39;&#39; which show the way &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; handles challenges. There are six &#39;&#39;Approaches&#39;&#39;: Careful, Clever, Flashy, Forceful, Quick and Sneaky. &#39;&#39;Approaches&#39;&#39; will change dynamically through the scenes and influence the choices you can make. But most stats are secret, like your Status stats. The character creation is one of a few occasions when you see some of them. Condition, Conflicts, Grades, Popularity and Privacy are the Status stats which form the base to determine your relations with other people. You can see their influence on your school life in the frame below the character creation. Status stats will change as the consequence of your actions that affect other characters in the game.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Why not? &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; looks very demonic to me. Isn&#39;t she a threat for your immortal soul?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She winced.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t believe in Hell,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she stated.

You chuckled.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, and horror movies show us the optimistic vision of the afterlife,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said. She chuckled too. It was a reference to the famous conversation between Stanley Kubrick and Steven King on the set of &quot;The Shining&quot;. 

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, one thing is certain. That math lesson was totally directed by Stanley. The longest frame since the conference on the Moon.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Any time, my lad. But I have to say, I&#39;m quite curious about what kind of girl you&#39;d become. I bet you&#39;d be very pink and sweet. And you&#39;d squeak a lot.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You rolled your eyes.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Seriously?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She spread her hands.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I heard you squeak once, you know. Believe me, it was very memorable.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I was ten!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you exclaimed.

Yeah, it seemed she did. However, you waited for her laughter. You wanted to hear you fell for another story, that you were naive and she did something else. But she was serious and even a little resigned.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It seems I don&#39;t get to go to Heaven.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;If you make a deal with &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39;, she&#39;ll hug whoever you want,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she explained. Her voice was calm, but you knew her too well. She was concerned. 

You sighed.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;What price?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you asked.

She shrugged. She showed you her hand. You realized that the bandage was soaking with blood. It had to be a deep cut.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;A little blood. Of course, we will see where it leads. But &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; seems to be fine.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She shrugged again.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Where are those fucking burgers? I&#39;ll lose my appetite...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You thought for a moment. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; looked at you, clearly impatient.

She chuckled.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure. Like I always ask you.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It wasn&#39;t about me, was it? You simply wanted to take revenge on &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. Am I right?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You are changing the subject.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; sighed.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Ok, you won! I admit. I didn&#39;t tell you because you wouldn&#39;t let me make a deal. You would whine and grumble as always. Happy? Did you want to hear that?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She chuckled.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, like what?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She had a point. With what  you understood of the occult, your options seemed to be limited.

You blushed. It could be understood as a figure of speech, but &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; knew you too well. Her eyes bulged  out.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;What?!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she exclaimed.

I... Fuck! I don&#39;t know what to say.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

It was a unique event in the history of the Universe. The death hush fell. You didn&#39;t interrupt it. 

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Well...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; finally said. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m sorry for ruining the opportunity. I had no idea. Seriously. I&#39;ve known you your entire life and you&#39;ve never given me the slightest tip.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You forced yourself to smile.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You know, I wouldn&#39;t volunteer myself like &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; did. But if that happened... Eh, whatever. Maybe that&#39;s better. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was such a creep today. He expected me to become some bimbo. &lt;&lt;if $robertPlans == true&gt;&gt;He wanted to make me his whore. He acted like he made some deal with &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; about me.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $robertScar == true&gt;&gt;He even cut himself, just like you did. Maybe I sometimes think about being a girl - I think every boy in this fucking school has to think about it - but I don&#39;t want to be a jock&#39;s bitch.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, that whole modeling thing was overrated,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I imagined our sweet &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; differently, but whatever. I won’t complain. Like I said, &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; loves her job. She doesn&#39;t give a shit about our fantasies.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

But she still looked at you seriously.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You know... I can call you &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; sometimes, if that will cheer you up.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;[[Your order is ready.|Meal&#39;s ready]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="146" name="&quot;I&#39;d rather be a girl than let my friend to pact with that stone bitch!&quot;" tags="" position="10087,654" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;d rather be a girl than let my friend pact with that stone bitch!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Wow, boy, that was deep.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; looked surprised which angered you.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Come on. We&#39;ve been in this school for three years. Anyone can be hugged. Haven&#39;t you thought about it? Two or three guys overdose on drugs, they could be arrested anytime. Some girl would grow dick then. It could be you, couldn&#39;t it?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She pondered it for a while.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I wonder why we haven&#39;t talked about it.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Not that persuading you can change your mind.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She smirked.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe not. But I appreciate every time you try.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You rolled your eyes. Here she was, an artist of inconsistency.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ve got a bad feeling about this. &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; is evil. No one should communicate with her, nor cut for her.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, you convinced me. I won&#39;t do it again. Scout&#39;s honor.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;[[Your order is ready.|Meal&#39;s ready]]

While she really needed to take care of her hand, you were aware it was also an excuse to not finish the conversation since she didn&#39;t like the way it led. Avoiding inconvenient topics was one of her biggest defects. So, a deathly hush fell. It was a super first date, indeed. 

Fortunately, your meal was ready soon, so you went to get it. When you came back, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; had just finished and threw some bloody bandages into the nearest bin.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Thank God, the burgers came!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she exclaimed.

The meal improved her humor again. You were fascinated as always how quickly she could switch between good and bad moods and how easily you could measure those changes. When you ate, she mockingly asked if you’d leave the tip. Burgers definitely earned that. 

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Ok, whatever you think about my new occult hobby,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said as you left the food truck area, &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I am really glad it worked the way I planned. It was an improvisation in some details, you know.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You didn&#39;t.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah? So what could happen?&quot;,&lt;/span&gt; you ask.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; used the ritual to volunteer herself to the pussy team. So I had to change some details to make sure, you know, to blast Auntie&#39;s hug to our sweet &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. But it worked, obviously.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $approaches.contains(1) or $approaches.contains(6)&gt;&gt;//She looked like she wanted to convince herself. It reminded you that she and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; had some quarrels last year. If you were &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, you wouldn&#39;t take the advice in such a serious matter from her.//&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $marthaOliviaquarrel=true&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;So you weren&#39;t sure what you were doing when you pacted with a dangerous spirit?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you asked ironically. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I am so surprised...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hey! Get off me! IT WORKED!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

It was so funny to look at her now. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; clearly just started to realize how risky was the pact with Auntie. She was freaking out. She, who would only have mischievous comments for everybody&#39;s doubts, was finally thrown from the peak of her ego. You just couldn&#39;t stop yourself and said:

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;How do you know?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Ha. Ha. Ha. Very funny. V e r y. Piss off. Do you need glasses, you moron? Do I look like a boy to you? I&#39;ve grown some tits, you know.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She bounced her rather modest cleavage and smirked. Oh, so she restored her balance. What a pity. 

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe you are in the shemale category,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you continued. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I can&#39;t tell, I&#39;m not an expert...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, I know, I talked to your mom about your browser history! She said you prefer MILFs, you motherfuck... oooh, fuck!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; shouted with pain.

She stopped. Her face turned pale. She put her hand on her crotch. Her eyes widened out as she touched her groin. When she finally spoke, her voice was a little deeper than earlier. 

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Holy shit!

The square in front of the school was also deserted.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Like in &quot;Devil&#39;s Advocate&quot;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you muttered. 

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; nodded her head. She was serious and focused. She slowly approached the statue. You stood behind her. 

&#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; was observing you. There was something living in her stone eyes. Living and... impatient. You felt her excitement.

You expected that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; would say something. Maybe she made some gestures. But no. She just looked at the statue for a while, then she deeply cut her left hand. She winced. It looked like she wanted to break the knife away, but she couldn&#39;t. She groaned.

Finally, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; put her knife away and put her hand on the statue&#39;s mouth. You could swear you saw some kind of light radiating from &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. 

There was a long minute before she pulled away from &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39;. The cut was deep and looked awful. There wasn’t a single drop of blood on the statue. It somehow... soaked in.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; turned to you. She looked weak and fragile. She hugged you.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks for coming, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she whispered to your ear. You stroked her hair.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Always,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you answered. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;But don&#39;t do that too often, please.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She chuckled and stepped back.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Ok.

You forced yourself to smile.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Easy, guys,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ll do it.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You took off your shirt and undershirt.. You saw the relief on their faces.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You are trying too hard, guys&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you continued. The bra was soft in touch and generally looked nice.

You blew him a kiss. He winced. He clearly wanted to humiliate you.

Everyone laughed. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; came closer. The hook and eye were also challenging for his big hands.

He chuckled.
&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Soon enough, don&#39;t worry.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Then you stood in front of them in a bra. You realized that some guys weren&#39;t really interested in watching you. More and more people left.

How would you resist the other urges if you couldn&#39;t manage such a simple task?

Slowly you were calming down. That bra wasn&#39;t a big deal. Nobody could see it under your shirt. You decided to take it off after the next lesson.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;They set me up. They fooled me. Everybody.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, at least you didn&#39;t end like &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t have pussy. Ehhh...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he sighed. He looked at you. &lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;We would fuck right now. I would treat you well, you know. I can make a girl happy.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You winced.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Dude, stop it,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s weird enough that you are sitting naked in my room.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, you are right. But this is girly room, so it&#39;s not so weird...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You didn&#39;t know what to do. You didn&#39;t know how long you&#39;d get stuck in this dream with such entertaining company. You sighed and took your phone. You wondered if you had WI-FI in the void. 

Your phone buzzed. You realized it wasn&#39;t in a dream. You...&lt;/p&gt;[[...finally woke up!|Martha&#39;s call]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="169" name="Beaten" tags="" position="18022,288" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; threw you down on a bed. Before you could react, he was there. He pressed you over. He was too strong. You were hitting him, but your punches didn&#39;t stop him. You wanted to shout, but you couldn&#39;t. Even you could, who&#39;d hear you in that void?

His hands were wandering through your body. He touched your nipples, even put his finger to your navel. You were struggling and kicking and he was just grinning.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;How beautiful you will be, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He leaned over you and kissed deeply. Your world was covered by his face. He forced you to open your mouth widely and pushed his tongue. You wanted to gag, you wanted to hit him, to bite him. Hundreds of raging thoughts went through your panicking mind. Your only hope was that you&#39;d wake up before he&#39;d rape you.&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if not visited(&quot;Touch it&quot;)&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;Bimbo-&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; giggled and encouraged him. She seemed to be stronger and louder when you got weaker.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Cut this foreplay! Let me out! Let me out!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; hands grasped your hips. He was starting to turn around. You saw one hand emerged from the piece of mirror. How much time she would need to replace you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;You were crying. The tears of fear and humiliation were soaking your cheeks and bedding. You couldn&#39;t breathe. You stopped even to hear sounds. The only thing you heard was your racing heart.

But then you heard something. Your phone buzzed. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; stopped. Your phone buzzed but not here. It buzzed...&lt;/p&gt;[[...in reality!|Martha&#39;s call]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="170" name="You won" tags="" position="18019,460" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You were sure that in the reality your struggle with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; would end in a few seconds. But it was a dream. Your dream. 

Your enemy was losing his strength quickly. You were wrestling for a while, but it was clear that you were winning. You saw fear in &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; eyes. Then you noticed something more.

You would call it a shadow. You couldn&#39;t describe its shape, but clearly, it wasn&#39;t shapeless. He reminded you of thick steam. Maybe even not steam, but something between smoke and steam.

This shadow was above us, under your lamp. Every moment you were winning you could see it was falling slowly. Finally it touched &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.

At this moment the fight was over. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; let you go. He dropped on his kneels. He smiled widely, but you saw a terror in his eyes.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;No, I&#39;m not into boys... I&#39;m not a f... homo,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. He didn&#39;t look at you, but to someone who could stand next to you. &lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;I lost a bet, you know. Besides, there are some things I want my girl to do to me... And she said that I have to do them myself first. Yeah, yeah. It&#39;s crazy. It&#39;s... crazy shit. What? Yeah, yeah, let&#39;s start...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You sat on your bed, stunning. You bulged your eyes out. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was giving a blow-job to not-exist person. His moves were really realistic, he got real hard mouth-fuck, he even choked for a moment. It wasn&#39;t something you watched every day. 

Then everything faded. &lt;/p&gt; [[The phone buzzed.|Martha&#39;s call]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="171" name="Martha&#39;s call" tags="" position="18361,327" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Third dream&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $auntie.Anger=0&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;You sat rapidly, breathing heavily. You were shivering. You were so cold that you were grating.

You looked at your buzzing phone. You remembered you muted it! You picked it up.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; said slyly. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Did you sleep well?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You sighed. But her voice caused that you got warmer. You observed how the goosebumps were vanishing from your skin.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;What&#39;s going on, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you asked. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s a middle of the night.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;I know,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said slightly. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s 3.00 AM. I had to wait to that hour, so appreciate my sacrifice.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Nice. Listen, if you wanted to interrupt one of these crazy dreams I had... Well, yeah. I appreciate it. I  really, really am. You probably know how... how exhausting they could be. So... Good night.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;I won&#39;t waste your time, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;! The centerpiece&#39;s just begun.

You sighed.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;What&#39;s going on, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you asked. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s a middle of the night.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;I know,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said slightly. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s 3.00 AM. I had to wait to that hour, so appreciate my sacrifice.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Nice. Listen, I haven&#39;t slept all night...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She interrupted you. 

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;I know, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. It was a smart move. You can go to sleep as we finish here.

Let&#39;s turn the light on.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

And the light in your room turned on. You jumped, shocked. Did you still dream? &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; giggled.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;What a shame that I can&#39;t see your face! I&#39;ve never done that before. Well, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. Be a nice boy and go to the mirror I gave you.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You got up, scared, and went to the mirror.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m there... Why... why are you doing this? Because it was you, right?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t spoil the moment. We&#39;ll have plenty of time to girl to girl talk later. Just enjoy the ride.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;But...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Shut up, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. Look in the mirror.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You were looking at your reflection. A young man only in his boxers. &lt;&lt;if $beAgirl ==true&gt;&gt;Your cock was half-erect. You felt the wave of excitement that was growing. That was happening.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; made a dramatic pause, but you heard her rapid breathing. She enjoyed the moment.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said like she was making a speech. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;As you liked my &lt;&lt;print $envy0&gt;&gt; most, it will be your first change.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You felt the wave of heat. &lt;&lt;if $envy[0]==&quot;breasts&quot;&gt;&gt;Your chest swollen. You weren&#39;t sure if you should look down or in the mirror. Your breasts were growing slowly. It looked like an accelerated process of normal development of breasts. Firstly the left breast grew a little and it was slightly larger than the right until they reached a size between A and B cups. Then they rounded, however they remained perky. The unfamiliar weight reminded you of a time when you broke your collarbone. You gained some weight then and the first in your life got some fat. Your new breasts were more solid in weight. Your nipples got bigger. They were changing too. In the beginning, they stuck out what looked odd. But when your chest reached the ultimate size, they looked fine. The aureolas around darkened a little but remained pink. 

You panted. You had breasts!&lt;&lt;elseif $envy[0]==&quot;face&quot;&gt;&gt;For a moment, nothing happened. Then this strange itching began, concentrating on your face. You touched it. You felt how it was changing. To your surprise, you didn&#39;t look more feminine. You looked younger. Your facial features softened, your eyes and mouth seemed to be bigger, just like ears. In a few moments, you recognized yourself from the class photos of the late elementary school. You were shocked. Was she making you a kid again?

But the changes only slower, but didn&#39;t end. Your face tingled again. Your nose looked smaller, the chin bones were a little higher. Your mouth darkened a little. Your eyebrows looked less prominent, your jaw rounded. There were subtle changes, but when they occurred you looked like a twelve-year-old girl. 

Then your face shifted. Your eyes seemed to be smaller, your eyelashes thicked and grew. Your skin was soft and flexible, however, you saw some reddish spots on them. It had to be your allergy to lactose. Your face became more mature, now you looked like a 14-15-year-old. This was a pretty girl face, but it just developing a more womanly appearance. You saw that process for a while until it stopped. You looked odd. You looked like a boy with a girl&#39;s face.&lt;&lt;elseif $envy[0]==&quot;hair&quot;&gt;&gt;You felt a tingle in your hair. It began to grow and lightened a little. You never had long hair, so you didn&#39;t really know if they were straight, but when they reached the height of your ears, they waved a little. Your face seemed to look smaller with the longer hair. Your hair grew slowly until it was shoulder-length. It tingled your neck. It felt like some insects sat on you. 

You swept your hair. It was thick and heavy. The fairer strands reflected in the light. They were soft and nice to touch.&lt;&lt;elseif $envy[0]==&quot;hands&quot;&gt;&gt;The tingling concentrated in your hands. You saw that they got smaller every second. The little hair you had on them vanished. Your fingers were decreasing also, but less than the rest of your hand. The fingers looked longer and thinner. The fingernails grew a little, but they remained quite short for a girl&#39;s hands.

Your arms got a little thinner too, so these delicate, slender hands you had now didn&#39;t look so out of place. &lt;&lt;elseif $envy[0]==&quot;legs&quot;&gt;&gt;Your legs felt oddly. You realized that the hair on them vanished. They were smooth. Everything around you seemed to become a little bigger, so you had to lose some of your height. Your hips widened. You had to sit down for a moment because the decreasing size of your feet caused that you lost your balance for a moment. Your feet were now slender and delicate. You lost several shoe sizes for sure. 

You stood up again. You had definitely a girl&#39;s legs. They were shaped and smooth. Maybe they weren&#39;t legs of the model, but definitely, it was a sight to see. You thought that you had better legs than &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

You were glad that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; couldn&#39;t see you. The process was extremely sexual and you got a massive hard-on.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, are you there?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; asked.

&lt;&lt;if $beAgirl==true&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m here,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you answered.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;My name&#39;s &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you hissed.

She giggled.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t be like that, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. Don&#39;t be too severe upon yourself. You have to admit, the changes and the... touches of &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; are nice. You are going to be a pretty girl.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Fuck you! You&#39;ve robbed me from my life!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;To fuck you I&#39;d have to rush. I&#39;m a boring heterosexual girl, after all.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

She chuckled.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;I will change you through the following day. But don&#39;t worry, your dick would be the last thing gone. I want you to celebrate the moment, so I think I&#39;ll give you your pussy after you go home. You can turn some romantic music, watch some films you like, drink wine... It&#39;s up to you, girl.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She yawned.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Nah, it&#39;s late. Listen, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. I won&#39;t hurt you. I didn&#39;t mean to turn you into a girl. It wasn&#39;t my idea. I saved you from &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. Be grateful enough to be nice to me. Goodnight.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She got off the phone. You turned off the light and came back to bed. You touched your new &lt;&lt;print $envy0&gt;&gt;. It reminded you a little of when you got your braces. Something new, unfamiliar attached to your body. But this time it was your body.

But you were time, so after a while you fell asleep. It seemed you had a big day ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The end of chapter 2&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/div&gt;[[The summary.|Chapter 2 summary]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="172" name="Investigation: Caroline" tags="" position="12739,365" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;set $investigation.push(&quot;Caroline&quot;)&gt;&gt;

They looked very excited. You didn&#39;t really blame them. Sex in school wasn&#39;t something that happened every day.

On the other hand, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; didn&#39;t look so excited. You were too far to hear the conversation, but you saw how tense she was. 

They went to the girls&#39; restroom on the first floor. It was the place where &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was transformed. You wondered if that place was somehow special for &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39;. But as it had a passage to the girls&#39; showers, it looked like a good idea.

You waited for a while next to the door and listened. You heard the creaking of the door, so you were right. Showers. You went to the restroom.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;So, are you into boys now, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she corrected. &lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know yet. I still like girls, but...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; -- she hesitated -- &lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;I want to try with you. I like you too.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Caroline&#39;s sex dream&quot;)&gt;&gt;So, she decided to use that line. Well, the boys liked it. It was a wicked version of the popular fantasy about &quot;curing&quot; lesbians with good heterosexual sex. In &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; case there was another trigger for boys. She used to be a boy, a rival to getting girls, and now she took the submissive role, serving their manhood.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Well, you could be overthinking that. There were two horny teenage boys and a girl who offered herself. Who&#39;d resist?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Caroline&#39;s sex dream&quot;)&gt;&gt;Whatever bad thing started during the dream, it obviously had its continuance here.

She was already on her knees with one student&#39;s cock in her hand. The second one had more doubts, because he seemed to be more distanced.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Your hands are cold,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; the first student hissed. 

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; smiled. She grabbed his balls and squeezed a little.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Not for long, I think...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said. She was stroking his cock for a while. Then, after a moment of hesitation, she started to lick it. He was moaning. It lasted maybe one minute before he ejaculated. His cum splashed on her face. She looked disappointed.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Already? Man, I think you didn&#39;t as many blowjobs as you said you had. You promised me a mouth-fuck. I counted on it.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Fuck off, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he snapped back. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;This day isn&#39;t over. I&#39;m warming up.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She snorted.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t have the whole day. What about you?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said to the other boy. &lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Second thoughts?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

The student blushed furiously.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I... I&#39;ll pass.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She snorted. She washed the cum off her face.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, don&#39;t be like that! Give me a minute, I&#39;ll get hard again!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;I have no time for this.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Fuck you, bitch! Who the fuck do you think you are!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She chuckled.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;I should be a proper slut. But you are useless for making me that. Bye, boys. Go back to your porn.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You backed off. Well, that was interesting.&lt;/p&gt;[[Day went on.|The concert talk]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="177" name="Interrupt sex" tags="" position="13209,263" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $backto = &quot;Interrupt sex&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $player.allowChangeApproach==1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $player.changeApproach = &quot;Forceful&quot;&gt;&gt;

You sighed loudly and went into the girls&#39; showers.

The school showers&#39; in &#39;&#39;Rosset High School&#39;&#39; were renovated in the year your country joined the European Union, so it was a while ago. Tiles were rough, and you&#39;d never take your shoes off here. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; had more courage than you, and clearly she didn&#39;t want to waste her time. She was already on her knees with one student&#39;s cock in her hand. The second one had more doubts, because he seemed to be more distanced.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Dude, what the fuck?!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; the one with the exposed cock exclaimed.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;This is a girls&#39; restroom!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; the second brilliantly noticed. 

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;Get the fuck out of there!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I can&#39;t let you do this,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said. 

Wow, what pathos. The students didn&#39;t appreciate this. The boy with the exposed cock hid it.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Next time, leave your boyfriend, bitch,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he muttered. 

They left you quickly. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; winced.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;What the fuck is your problem?!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she hissed. &lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Stop stalking me! Didn&#39;t you have enough fun yesterday?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, you didn&#39;t,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she admitted. She looked miserable and fragile then, when she was getting up from the floor.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Why do you do this?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She smiled weakly.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s the only way out... Eh, you won&#39;t understand.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Then explain it to me.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She hesitated for a moment, but then shook her head.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; wouldn&#39;t like it. She torments me enough now... Just... In case she hugs you today... Be careful whose cock you see first. He will gain some power over you.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Then she left quickly. You called out to her, but she didn&#39;t answer.&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $firstCock =true&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Should I remind you of how you treated me yesterday?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Fuck you! So I deserved this, right?!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;No, so don&#39;t act like that!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;ll see how you’ll act if &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; hugs you today!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

As it wasn&#39;t the cleanest place in the building, you thought about it with some disgust, but &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; could decide for herself.

You thought a little about her determination to get two boys at the same time. She didn&#39;t look very horny. She looked desperate, but not in the way that would end with sweaty, quick sex. 

Apparently, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; had something on her mind. As her last plan backfired spectacularly, you didn&#39;t see it as a threat. Youdidn&#39;t see her as a threat.

You blinked. Yes, you thought so. You didn&#39;t see &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; as a threat. It was incredible in many ways, as &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; had been a real pain in your ass for years. Much had changed.

&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Caroline&#39;s sex dream&quot;)&gt;&gt;You thought about the man in the suit during the dream and what he said about repaying debts.

You knew that &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; fed on people&#39;s feelings, but you didn&#39;t think of that as a kind of currency. Strange.&lt;/p&gt;[[Day went on.|The concert talk]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="179" name="Courtain room" tags="" position="11763,731" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Courtain room&quot;)==1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Courtain room&quot;)==1&gt;&gt;You came back home. It was hard to believe that only several hours had passed since you woke up from this crazy dream. The evening was calm, and you didn&#39;t complain about that.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; called you, but you didn&#39;t pick up the phone. You got tired of her. Much of the stress you experienced today was because of her recklessness. She should have told you about the plot. You could have prepared for this. &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $beAgirl==true&gt;&gt;If she was loyal to you, you&#39;d already be a girl. You&#39;d be &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. You sighed helplessly. Everything could be arranged another way.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt; 

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; didn&#39;t give up. She sent you a photo, then the description. It was a selfie, and she was bare-chested. Her cleavage was always rather modest, now it had disappeared completely. Her chest looked like the chest of a young, undeveloped boy.

You read the message. She wrote:

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I caused this. I look like this now.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You responded:

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I can&#39;t see a difference :P&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She answered really quickly:

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;FUCK YOU!!!!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You smirked and muted your phone. You were tired. You fell asleep early.

But even in your sleep you didn&#39;t get to relax. You found yourself in an odd place. It was a big room in some Victorian estate. The furniture was heavy and dark. The gaslight was flickering on a brass fitting. You stood on a thick carpet. The windows and walls were covered by dark red curtains. &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;In private&quot;)&gt;&gt;You recognized them from the previous dream.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;

There was a round table in the middle of the room and four chairs around it. When you came closer, you realized that it was prepared for some game. You noticed cards that had already been dealt and poker tokens. There were empty glasses. They got your attention because there were names on them. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. There was the fifth set of cards and a stack of chips next to it. There was also an empty pedestal between two chairs. &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; wasn&#39;t there but you were sure that  was just temporary.

Then you noticed some things simultaneously. 

You heard some muffled moans behind the curtain on your left. You heard the voice of this moaning woman from somewhere.

You noticed the richly decorated mirror. There was something odd with the reflection. You realized there was some girl in this mirror. She had really huge breasts and a slutty smile on her face. 

You felt a wind. The curtain on your right was moving delicately. When it raised, you saw mild blue light shine through.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You were in the middle of the room again. &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Cover it&quot;)&gt;&gt;You kept hearing the muffled moans of &#39;&#39;Bimbo-&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;hint&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;width:200px;&quot;&gt;Remaining choices: &lt;&lt;print $choicesRemain&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The girl in reflection waved to you, pouting her lips. She looked grotesque. As she was quite short and slim, she had enormously huge breasts. You weren&#39;t sure about the sizes, but you&#39;d bet probably F or G cups. In her tight clothes her breasts looked even bigger. She looked like a total slut.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Liking what you see?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she asked joyfully. &lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m getting ready for &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;... Mmmm... I&#39;m so ready for him...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She giggled and slowly took off her mini skirt. She put her hand with long and pink fingernails into her thongs.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Mmmm... I&#39;m so wet...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

She rubbed her clit and caressed her enormous breast.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;! &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;! Take your slut! Take her! Take your &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

The first thought you had seemed to be out of place, because you thought that it was strange that this &#39;&#39;Bimbo-&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; didn&#39;t call &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; a master. But it all was serious. Real-life wasn&#39;t porn. You tried to imagine how your friends and parents would react to this... this creature. You thought about your life. It wasn&#39;t ideal, of course, but you had some dreams and plans. You wouldn&#39;t mind sex, but focusing all on wrapping those puffy lips around the jock&#39;s cock was so degrading that your hands clenched into fists. &lt;&lt;if $approaches.contains(2) or $approaches.contains(5)&gt;&gt;//You realized that &#39;&#39;Bimbo-&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; stopped caressing her breast for a moment and her hand mimicked your gesture.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I can&#39;t wait to be there,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said between moans. &lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;But I&#39;m such a silly girl... I have to learn a lot... Mmmm... Oooooh... &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

It dominated the room. It was so high that you had to stand on tiptoe to look at it well.

There were stacks of poker chips. There were hundreds of them. You couldn&#39;t describe the colors of chips. When you thought about them later, you always used the term &quot;Lovecraftian&quot;. It turned out that it fit them well. Firstly, those strange tokens glittered in the unnamed, strange colors that could be described in the stories of Solitary of Providence. Secondly, love as a craft seemed to be a stake in &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;s&#39;&#39; game.

Then, when you first saw them you thought that they were beautiful and deadly, as some predators were. The reflection of the light caused them to appear to move a little, as if they breathed. It was a strange thought to have about a stack of chips in the middle of the table, but they seemed to lurk. You wouldn&#39;t touch them. You wouldn&#39;t... disturb them.

They smelled too. They smelled of sperm, sex, sweat, and perfumes. They smelled of drugs and alcohol. If an orgy could melt into one smell, it would be this intoxicating odor. But it wasn&#39;t everything. Chips smelled of blood and violence, fear, and death. 

You felt the warmth radiating from them. Then you looked away, shivering.

The cards were far less interesting, as they were face down. You could only count them. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; had eight, 
&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; two, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; only one.&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $auntie.Anger gt 0 and $approaches.contains(2)&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;//Then you noticed one card that wasn&#39;t faced down.

It was a Summer evening, and you saw a few people around, gathering around the ice cream parlor. 

The surroundings looked familiar. You looked around. This breakwater looked the same as the one which saved your uncle &#39;&#39;Stan&#39;s&#39;&#39; life during the vacation... how many... 12 years ago?

You noticed a little boy digging on the shore. There was a lot of sand in his hair. He was really engaged in this digging. He clearly was looking for something.

You saw a little girl who was observing the boy from a distance. She had to be his age. She wore a green one-piece swimsuit and a straw hat with a green ribbon. 

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;&lt;textbox &quot;$they.justinName&quot; &quot;Justin&quot;&gt;&gt;, stop it!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she exclaimed. Her thin voice was really loud. &lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You won&#39;t find them!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; She nearly sang.

The little boy stopped and looked at her. His chubby face was comically serious. He squinted his eyes.

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;I will!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he shouted back as he started to dig again, furiously.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You woooon&#39;t!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

The girl came closer to the boy. He shouted:

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;I wiiiiiiiiill!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Children, can you keep your voices down a little?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; the voice behind you said. You jumped. The man who said that and who was now walking to the toddlers was your father! The younger version of him, though. Your parents were 21 when you were born. This man couldn&#39;t be older than 27, maybe 28. 

The boy froze and blushed furiously. He stood up, staring at the ground.

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sorry, sorry, sorry...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he mumbled.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Wow, boy, relax! Easy!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; your father exclaimed. He squatted down next to the boy and stroked his hair, smiling warmly. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I didn&#39;t tell you that something is wrong. I asked you to be a little quieter. That&#39;s all. What are you doing here?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

The boy took a peek at the girl, who sighed loudly and rolled her eyes theatrically. 

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; dug in her dolls here,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. 

Your father’s eyes bulged out.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Why did you do that?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he asked the girl who stomped her little foot. Her face went red.

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;Because the boys said that pirates don&#39;t play with dolls,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; the boy explained. &lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;But this is stupid. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; is a pirate girl. I am a pirate boy and I play with cars. She can play with all the toys she wants.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Little &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; looked like she was going to cry. Her father opened his arms. She hesitated for a moment, but she hugged him. She started to sob.

What a scene. After the curtain room, you didn&#39;t expect something like that. You decided to...&lt;/p&gt;[[...stay there.|Remain there]]

There was a tall man in his late twenties or early thirties, handsome and dressed in an expensive, well-fitting suit. His look was cruel, his smile insolent. He was lighting a cigarette and clearly enjoying his time. As he stood in front of the curtain, he saw you and blinked knowingly. The girl kneeling before him was naked. She was turned around, with her face at his groin level. 

It was &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Come on, little sister,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he encouraged her mockingly. &lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;You’ve been hesitating for so long that I’m starting to think you want to stay this way. Maybe I’m not your crush? Maybe you’ve met some other guy you want to blow?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;No, I&#39;ll do it. I&#39;ll do it.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;  &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; squeezed through the clenched teeth. She sounded helpless and desperate. &lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Just give me a moment. I&#39;ve never done this before.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He patted her head in a very patronizing manner. You realized why you thought this man was the devil. There was something... demonic in his smile. He reminded you of the &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; from your dream.

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Good. Boys love that line. You are my first. I&#39;ve never seen such a big cock!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he mocked. Apparently he had a lot of fun knowing that you were witnessing this scene and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; wasn&#39;t aware of your presence. &lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;But I have a better line for you. Say it: I thought I was into girls but I want to try with a man like you.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He laughed. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; carefully touched his exposed cock with her hand. She started to stroke it.

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s it, girl. Now you start repaying your debts. Poor &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; worked so hard to improve you. Show some gratitude. Now, do something I can&#39;t do myself.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She touched his cock with her tongue. The man wasn&#39;t looking at her. He looked at you. You decided to...&lt;/p&gt;[[...interfere.|Stop her]] &lt;&lt;forceful $display&gt;&gt;

He switched the router off.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;What the fuck?!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

The tall man patted her head again.

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t bother, sis. Get used to the audience during the play. &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; pays more for when you show off a little.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was slowly warming up. You couldn&#39;t see her face as you stood behind her, but you saw and heard that she was licking more vigorously. The man in the suit was smiling widely.

She stopped for a while.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;I want to make you happy.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He laughed.

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;I almost believe you. You are a quick learner.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She took his cock with her slender fingers.

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Woo. Easy, girl. You don&#39;t have to do it for the first time. Such enthusiasm... Ok, take it. Watch your teeth, bitch!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She muttered something. It was hard to comment with cock in her mouth. He grabbed her head and started to push. It didn&#39;t last long. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was choking.

It was a thing you&#39;d expect of your reflection, but one glance at her face told you she wasn&#39;t pleased by your move. She was afraid.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Wait!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she exclaimed.

You smirked.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Why should I?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you sneered. You made another step and then she backed off.

A smart brain wasn&#39;t a trait &#39;&#39;Bimbo-&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; had. She was invented for other purposes. She flashed you with her most slutty face.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Turn around! I&#39;ll leave this mirror and... and we could fuck!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She revealed her huge tits even more and bounced them. You had to admit that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; imagined two masterpieces. The darker areolas were just the perfect background for her perky, erect nipples.

But you took your shirt and pulled it. The reflection had to cover herself. &#39;&#39;Bimbo-&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; squeaked.

You stood in front of the mirror. You noticed the tears that ruined her heavy makeup.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You don&#39;t deserve him! You don&#39;t know what he did to get you!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;To get me or to get you?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you asked and touched the mirror.

Your hand went through, but it changed. She blurred, then melted. When you backed off, your reflection looked different. It was still a girl. &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Watch&quot;)&gt;&gt;You saw her before. It was the girl you saw in the mirror in the girls&#39; restroom.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;The girl in the mirror could be your twin sister. Well, your good looking twin sister. She had your blue eyes and dirty-blond hair, however it was a little lighter. You could see some resemblance in the shape of the nose and lips, but they were much more delicate than yours. You couldn&#39;t help but look lower. &#39;&#39;Bimbo-&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; made you think about breasts. But this &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was a cute girl next door.

It had to be one of &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;s&#39;&#39; tricks. It reminded you of how she tried to influence your mind. But, well, that reflection couldn&#39;t harm you.

You sighed and smiled. She had a nice smile. &lt;/p&gt;[[You came back to the middle of the room.|Courtain room]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="188" name="Cover it" tags="" position="12048,540" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $backto = &quot;Cover it&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $player.allowChangeApproach==1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $player.changeApproach = &quot;Clever&quot;&gt;&gt;

You walked quickly through the room and covered the mirror. It was a moment of quiet, but after a few seconds you heard that &#39;&#39;Bimbo-&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was playing with herself again.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;We don&#39;t listen to stupid people,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she muttered and giggled between sobs. Your father kissed her on the forehead. You smiled. He still repeated this &quot;golden rule&quot;. 

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s my clever girl! You can&#39;t do something if it is dangerous, if you are too young to do so, or you promise to not do something. But hey!

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;We are not them!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

He was holding this uncomfortable position for too long. When he wanted to stand up, he lost his balance and fell into the water with two squealing toddlers. There were a lot of screams and splashing. They had a great time.

You realized that your father looked different. There was some aura around him. Something... glowing. Your father glowed and this shine increased.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;No, I woke up. How about you?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

It was even more creepy than his grins.&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $beAgirl==true&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The transformation itself didn&#39;t worry you much.

You looked around. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; sat next to you. She... Yes, you still referred to her as a girl, but if you didn&#39;t know her you&#39;d say she was a boy already. She was handling the situation very well.

On the other hand, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; acted like a victim. She sat in the last row of the classroom. She was terrified and didn&#39;t answer the nasty comments. And clearly, she didn&#39;t sleep well last night.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t try to stop me.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you warned her.

She rolled her eyes.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; avoided &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. She ignored all the comments, glances, and smiles.

Her new genitals caused her constant problems and she was clearly ashamed to touch them. She was taller than all the girls and most of the boys, so she felt like she was walking on display.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; finally provoked &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; reaction.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;What poetic justice,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; hissed.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;What?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;You have always been a dick, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, so it was a matter of time before you grew one.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She was helpful, of course. If you needed some action, she would act. But her comments and smirks were hard to handle. Yesterday she laughed at your stress. So, as she was fine now, it was nice to get some payback.

Her transformation to &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; went smoothly. She remained herself. Of course, as a boy, she was much taller, but she kept most of her traits. The other students’ comments were mostly positive. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was a tomboy, so most people claimed her change  was something natural...

She relaxed a little in your company. She allowed some sighs and sad looks. She was saying goodbye to her previous life. You&#39;d never seen her more serious when she said:

The buildings were endangered by collapsing, but they weren&#39;t fenced. Even the school bench here was more damaged. Some holes wagging students used to ran off the lessons. 

The Spring&#39;s warmth caused the ruins to stank heavily of decay and filth.

You approached. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; pulled the bandages out of her backpack and gave them to you. Then she took off her shoe.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I thought it had to be a left leg,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said.

She chuckled. She sprayed the wound with antiseptic. 

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ve spread this rumor to get know who would decide to perform a ritual,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said with a wry smile. Then she sighed. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;This wound has two weeks. Can you believe it?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;It won&#39;t cicatrize until I&#39;d start to fulfil the obligations. It won&#39;t be long.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;So...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you started. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I see that this guy had at least one listener.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She smiled. Damn, how cute was her smile.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Didn&#39;t you listen? I thought you are into history.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, but it means reading books, not digging corpses up.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;They do a good job with those graves, but when I hear those historians it looks like living always have to give a place to the dead. And historians aren&#39;t the worst, you know.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Did your mom share with some spicy story?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

You shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Nothing spicy. If you don&#39;t want to give money for another statue or inscription on the wall, you are Jew, mason, Communist or Russian agent. I worked in the bookstore lately... I had to repay my father for a ticket... And really I regret that I told some clients I&#39;m interested in history... Jesus Christ! These people are mad!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She smirked.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Some of them are. Most of them. But some... are haunted.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You chuckled. 

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I doubt it. I mean... That would be a perfect excuse for the combination of mental disorder and hideous personality. Believe me.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; looked at you carefully.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure. You can diagnose mental disorder.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Excuse me?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

But then she sighed loudly.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;ve got company.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

You looked in the same direction. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was approaching quickly.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Shit.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;You can back off. I&#39;ll handle this. Really,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she added when she saw your surprised look. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t you have enough of this creep?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, I think you showed it before.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; bit his lip, but he didn&#39;t hide his dick. He was clearly waiting for something. You looked at him, then you looked at &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, who laughed loudly.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, my God! It was so subtle!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she exclaimed. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, you should start sucking his dick right now!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;  

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Well...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you cleared your throat. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Uhm... I don&#39;t feel like sucking a cock. I know it&#39;s a big disappointment for you.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; pulled a face. He hid his member. The situation was so absurd that put you in a good mood. 

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Let&#39;s say it, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you continued sarcastically. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You and me...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; -- you pointed at him and you, then shrugged -- &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;ll never work! I can&#39;t say that it&#39;s about me and not about you... Because it&#39;s all about you. You are the biggest creep I ever met.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; laughed openly. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; winced.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; showed you her cock, didn&#39;t she?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he snapped. &lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;ll be her bitch as always, won&#39;t you? And I&#39;ll end up with nothing! After everything I did!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;What did you do, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she asked sweetly. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe you should tell &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; how real ritual looked like? He will be really touched by your story.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

His face went pale. You looked at him with interest.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;ve got my attention. I can barely wait.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He bit his lip again. 

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, maybe later. Let&#39;s face it, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. That all &quot;showing-a-dick-to-enslave-thing&quot; is bullshit. You&#39;ve believed in the most idiotic gossip about the Parity. &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; was a feminist, remember? She wouldn&#39;t let any girl be enslaved by looking at some cock. &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; claimed that man should earn his woman.

He stepped forward, angry.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Shut up, bitch! You know what I had to do! I won&#39;t let anybody rob me!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Nobody can rob you from your precious memories. And if you don&#39;t want all school to know about your... adventures, you&#39;ll back off.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He stepped back. He was angry, but also scared. Without a word, he turned around and left.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; snorted.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Boys,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she muttered.

Is &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; cock really bigger than his?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You rolled your eyes.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m getting really tired of discussing other boys&#39; cocks.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; approached quickly.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Where is she?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he demanded. 

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Who?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; asked innocently. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;?

The caretakers mowed the grass, but they left the rubbish students threw through windows. The school area contacted there with ruined tenement houses. The buildings were endangered by collapsing, but they weren&#39;t fenced. Even the school bench here was more damaged. Some holes wagging students used to ran off the lessons.

The Spring&#39;s warmth caused the ruins to stank heavily of decay and filth. Some people from the neighborhood threw there their trash, especially since the costs of garbage disposal rise in the whole city. Local drinkers and junkies inhabited them during the warm seasons.

You saw &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. She went through the littered lawn. She stopped next to the place where the bench was completely removed. You realized she was standing next to the grave you heard during the lecture. She pulled a rose out of her backpack and put it on the ground. Then she turned around and she saw you, but she didn&#39;t give a sign to &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; who approached quickly.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You did well to hide.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Wow, look at you,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; said. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hard day, huh? Do you want some relief?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She put her delicate hand on his groin.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Cut bullshit!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he exclaimed. But he didn&#39;t took her hand away. &lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Nothing works! You did something! Fuck off her! Fuck off us!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

But she still was caressing his cock.

He shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe it must be a real cock. I suppose.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She giggled. She pulled his cock out and started stroking it. 

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe the whole &quot;showing-a-dick-to-enslave-thing&quot; is bullshit,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said distinctly. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;But do you know what can be real? Pain.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

The stuffed unicorn dominated your bed. New furniture made the impression that everything changed, that your new room was cleaned out your things. But it wasn&#39;t.

You realized with huge relief that your bookshelf didn&#39;t change at all. Still, you had your horror novels collections, RPG handbooks, and some fantasy books. The changes were subtle and rather positive. You didn&#39;t have some books you received as presents. Apparently, people didn&#39;t buy them for even such nerdy girl as &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. You would live without those all missed gifts.

You had posters on the walls. Two of them you had earlier, but you didn&#39;t hang them - the album cover &quot;Celtic maidens&quot; and &quot;Firefly&quot;. You bought them at the same convention where you bought a t-shirt with Jurassic Park&#39;s logo.

There were new things. You had some colorful boxes on the parapet. Cactus in your room was in the shiny flower pot. The bedside lamp was decorated with flowers. You found earrings next to it, but they were nice and simple.

The mirror was something new too. You couldn&#39;t remember you saw it somewhere before. It looked old. Old and expensive. It was big enough that you could see yourself head-to-toe. 

But there was something that changed even more.&lt;/p&gt;[[Your wardrobe.|Wardrobe]]

His glasses were foggy because of sweat. He held a map on his knees and studying carefully. He was counting the distance route we went. During the trip, he was moved by how inaccurate signposts were. He seemed to be unaware of the pandemonium that was behind him.

You and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; (&#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; shifted the reality) were fighting. He held your hat and you held his expensive headphones.

It was larger and there was a mirror on the inside of its door. On the left, there were three shelves and four drawers, on the right there were hangers with jackets and at least one dress.

You thought that your wardrobe wasn&#39;t very feminine. You couldn&#39;t find any pink cloth. The colors remained yours - black, green, gray, and blue. You still had some of your more nerdy things, and even some new. You didn&#39;t have earlier this &quot;Stranger Things&quot; hoodie for sure.

Apparently you had easier start than &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, who ended with slutty skirts and tops. That was an ultimate proof that it wasn&#39;t &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; who stood behind your transformation.

Well, that was the first sight.&lt;/p&gt;[[You looked closer.|Try them]]

&lt;&lt;print $resistance&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you weren&#39;t on set of &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;, but it turned out that dreams were exhausting. You were young, many times you couldn&#39;t sleep or sleep a few hours and remained focus and conscious. 

Luckily, you had a lot of coffee in your home. Your father was drinking liters of it while working on big projects. You didn&#39;t like the coffee he bought, it was definitely too strong and sour for you. You remembered what he said to you once: &quot;I don&#39;t drink it because of its taste, but because of abilities to raise up the dead&quot;. You needed something like that.

But well, you were tired. You saw and experienced many exhausting things. Maybe part of this tiredness was caused by &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39;. Well, she was a demonic bitch that would change your life drastically, but you could be simply tired because of two stressful days. 

Time was passing slowly. Annoyingly, the whole Internet you scrolled was boring. Maybe you had to watch a film.&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Try not to sleep&quot;) gte 2&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was strange. You watched 3 films on the &quot;Bug wars&quot; channel and still were sleepy. Usually, the sight of scolopendra was enough to make your heart race, and the fight mantis versus scolopendra was like a spin-off of &quot;Alien vs Predator&quot;. But you were yawning so hard that your jaw actually caused a strange clicky sound and ached a little.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Try not to sleep&quot;)==3&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You opened the window. That was a cold April night. A light wind sobered you a little. This night reminded you of the night watches during scouts&#39; camps. The difference was that you really didn&#39;t sleep all time.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of the night passed. Your clock beeped at 3.00 AM.

He would be the only one of your closest friends who forgot you. He never crossed the threshold of &#39;&#39;Rosset high school&#39;&#39;, he didn&#39;t meet the terror lurking in the shadow of the &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;s&#39;&#39; bust. He knew the other shadows, though.

But &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was like a brother. Your father and mother cared about him more than his own parents.

You&#39;d never met nicer boy than &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. He had this natural kindness that was impossible to learn. His calm voice, mild eyes, and always serious face always made you feel safe. You&#39;d never heard him complaining. However, you should.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; once said that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; had a double citizenship because he raised in Hell. His parents drank. His father was aggressive and beat him and his mother. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was always scared and hungry kid. He had no toys. Even when he was a five-year-old kid, he wandered around without a care. He stayed away from kids on the playground. They laughed at his height and his dirty clothes. He played with the kittens from basements.

When you finally met you became best friends. Your parents persuaded his mother to let him on the holidays with you. It was a time your mother started to work as a social worker and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; parents wanted to use their son to establish a familiarity with this young, idealistic woman. They counted on the special treatment when they applied for benefits. They underestimated her.

You thought about your common history and you felt anger. Some &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; took your place. When &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; would come on Friday to the city for a concert, it&#39;d be worse than you were dead to him.

As she was one year older than you, she&#39;d graduate in May.

You didn&#39;t want to talk with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; about &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. You didn&#39;t talk about her with anyone, however, people were asking you. You were still angry at her.

She entered your life later than &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. You were twelve, she was thirteen. She moved in because her father got the position of the head physician in the local hospital. Her parents bought the apartment in one of the renovated tenement houses. Compared to typical residents in this neighborhood, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; family was rich. The owner of the tenement house hired security and receptionists. The estate of renovated buildings was fenced off. It was an isolated island of wealth among poverty.

You met her because of your mother. It was her first cadence as a councilor. She commanded you to go to the town hall at the Christmas meeting. You had to be charming for all these old men and women. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; father attended this meeting. He brought his daughter to build a positive image. You both were outraged by this hypocrisy. You shared a disgust.

You became friends. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was neglected like &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, her family was wealthier than yours but you both belonged to middle class. It turned out her father beat her, so she had a lot of common with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. 

She fit. And she inspired you. She always knew better, did better. She had ambitions. Now you were thinking that she was just like your mother, but then you thought she was completely different.

The last evening as a boy. It was strangely calm and peaceful. You did your homework. You spent even some time with your parents. Your father continued his ritual of finishing the project. He usually watched some of his favorite musicals: &quot;Hair&quot;, &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; or &quot;Fiddler of the roof&quot;. This evening he decided to watch &quot;Hamilton&quot; for the first time. Even your mother seemed to have a good fun. She didn&#39;t pick up any phones and she looked relaxed. You even watched the beginning with them. Well, maybe you&#39;d watch it later with your friends. &quot;Hamilton&quot; was a quite popular but because it was so popular you didn&#39;t watch it yet.

But it was a strange evening. You felt like you&#39;d wait for a flight or a train. You often checked the time, nervous. 

The reality shifted again when you took a shower. Earlier you noticed that you had a lot of cosmetics you didn&#39;t have. Now your last set of the old clothes you had before changed. As a girl, you&#39;d wear today a dark green top, white panties, white bra and socks with clovers. &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Struggle&quot;)&gt;&gt;Luckily, your father lived with you and his clothes dried. You wore his boxers.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You wore grey shorts that didn&#39;t really fit.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; You didn&#39;t wear any shirt or t-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;[[You decided not to sleep today.|Try not to sleep]]

She had short dark hair and a rather pale complexion. She barely used any makeup. She usually grinned in the way you would expect on the Cheshire Cat, if he was a schoolgirl from cursed high school. She didn&#39;t care much about her clothing. You probably never saw her in a skirt since kindergarten. She wore combat pants as usual, as she held nearly everything in the pockets. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt; She looked at you with a concern.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Son of a bitch!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she exclaimed. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ll fuck him with a broomstick when he grows a cunt! We&#39;ll see how he&#39;ll wear a bra in front of the boys.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You knew that &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; would hug someone today, didn&#39;t you?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you asked. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You knew and didn&#39;t tell me.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; shrugged.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she admitted slightly, recklessly, like always. She even smiled. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I didn&#39;t want to bother you. I&#39;ve handled this. Don&#39;t worry, dude. The seat in the pussy team is taken. The next bra &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; is going to buy will match his new panties.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Not bother me? &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, come on! There is a fucking conspiracy against me and you didn&#39;t warn me! It looks like you either are a part of it or don&#39;t give a shit about me!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You didn&#39;t know which eventuality would worry you more. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was your friend. Real friend. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Her face darkened.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hold your horses, agent Mulder,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You are upset, I get it. We&#39;ll laugh about it in a few hours, I promise you. I&#39;ll tell you everything. I&#39;ve done nothing that puts your balls in danger. However, I need to hunt &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; down, so don&#39;t freak out, please. Trust me.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You snorted.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Wow,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you snarled. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Let&#39;s sum up: you are using me as bait, then you are assuring me about my safety while you somehow deal with a demonic bitch, and then you want my trust. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, your negotiating skills are amazing.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
She shrugged.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m a fighter, not a talker. And I&#39;m on your side, as always. Come on, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I warned you it&#39;d be rough day,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You snorted.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you snorted. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You gave me... How much? 10 minutes for preparing for this fucking plot against me. You knew about this for a whole week! You called me every day and said nothing! You are helpful as hell.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; rolled her eyes.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Can you cut this whining?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she asked. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviafemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I didn&#39;t know what they planned. Or what they were going to do. So how exactly could you prepare for this? Would you hide for a whole day? You could only make things worse. Everything is handled.

Your balls have never been safer, pal.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
She was so sure, but &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; usually acted like she was in control of the situation, even (or especially) when everything had gone wrong. Moreover, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; had a lot of skills, but you couldn&#39;t name her an occult expert.

It looked different but familiar. Ceramic tiles were blue, just like they were when you were a child. You look at the bathtub and your heart sank. You recognized the toys you used to play with as a kid. You were a dinosaur freak then. You were proud of your collection of plastic reptiles. Then you saw something you didn&#39;t remember. It was a Barbie mermaid.

You turned around to confirm. You looked at the dirty clothes in a bowl next to the washing machine. There were a lot of definitely pink, girly tops and skirts. 

Was it the past? The version of history where you were born and raised as a girl?

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;We will wash our hands, ok, Rita?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You shuddered. It was your father&#39;s voice. Rita? But it meant that...

The door to the bathroom opened. The woman who went in didn&#39;t see you. You weren&#39;t surprised. You started to realize that you were just a spectator. But you were touched. Of course, you recognized her. She was aunt Rita, your neighbor&#39;s daughter. She had Down Syndrome and died several years ago. She was the most cheerful and warm person you ever met. You missed her. She looked like thirty, so the scene you saw had to take place a year or two before she died.

Her hands were smeared with paint. Your father went in and helped him to wash. He looked far worse than now. He was pale and tired, unshaved. Aunt Rita stained his shirt with yellow paint. 

Oh no. You knew what event &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; wanted to show you.

You heard the childish giggles before two toddlers ran into the bathroom. They were about eight. A boy wore glasses and too big clothes. His pant legs were rolled up. His fair shag was unruly like always. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.

The resolute girl with pigtails could be only...

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; your father exclaimed. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;What did I tell you about running in house? Especially in bathroom!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; blushed furiously. Like always, the slightest reprimand hurt him like a blow. But &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; just smiled.

You knew what she would tell.

Aunt &#39;&#39;Rita&#39;&#39; bulged her eyes out. She looked really concerned.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;What they do in your room? It&#39;s your room.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said.

Little &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was delighted that she had that audience. Your father blinked to &#39;&#39;Rita&#39;&#39; that it all was a joke, then pretended to be very serious.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You can&#39;t have the vampires in your bedroom. Vampires must be invited to the house. Did you invite any vampires lately?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; nodded. 

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;They were homeless, daddy. I gave them the dollhouse.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Originally, you didn&#39;t have a dollhouse, of course. You used the birdhouse your mother received as a part of some local project. The vampires were made of plasticine.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Did you give the dollhouse to the vampires? Where will Barbies live?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; pulled a face.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;The dolls will move out.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Your dad sighed. It looked like a continuation of the conversation he and his daughter had earlier.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I like vampires more. But you need to tell them how to behave. They don&#39;t listen to us.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Aunt &#39;&#39;Rita&#39;&#39; started to laugh.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, &#39;&#39;Pete&#39;&#39;, tell them!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she exclaimed. Your father looked at his watch. He winced.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Mom will be in any minute. She will write regulations for them. Ok?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

The little girl sighed. It was so evident mimic of gesture her father did you had to smirk. 

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;But then they will run away!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Then the intercom buzzed.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Speaking of the devil,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; your father muttered. To your surprise, his face darkened. He left a bathroom. Children came back to &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; room.&lt;/p&gt;[[You followed your father.|Follow father]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="216" name="Follow father" tags="" position="24885,967" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your father came to the door and opened it. You could see he was angry. Finally, your mother came. She looked tired.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;One day,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; your father hissed. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;All I wanted was one fucking day you wouldn&#39;t be late.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

Your mother looked at him calmly.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;The meeting ran along. As usual,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said. &lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m really as early as it was possible. You don&#39;t have to snarl at me. I&#39;m here. You can go.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You could say &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; sometimes, &#39;&#39;Liz&#39;&#39;&quot;,&lt;/span&gt; he said. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You fucked up. We agreed that you&#39;d leave the meeting on time, even if those idiots talked too much as always. But they are more important for you than your husband, aren&#39;t they?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;Pete&#39;&#39;, come on. I don&#39;t want to argue with you. You had one hour left. You&#39;ll be there on time.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t like the way you treat me, &#39;&#39;Liz&#39;&#39;&quot;,&lt;/span&gt; he said. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not your servant.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You were shocked. Of course, you remembered that your parents had some fights when you were a little kid, but you barely remembered them. Of course, you knew what caused this fight. It had to be the 17th of April. The anniversary of the death of your father&#39;s best friends. They got drunk and had a car accident. Your father had a strong survivor&#39;s guilt. 

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, you are here,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you heard the voice behind you. You turned around and saw aunt &#39;&#39;Rita&#39;&#39;. She was talking right to you! &lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Are you &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; guardian angel? You look even like her!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;[[You were speachless for a moment.|Rita&#39;s staring at you]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="217" name="Rita&#39;s staring at you" tags="" position="25210,1031" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Uhm... No. I&#39;m not a guardian angel,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said.

Aunt &#39;&#39;Rita&#39;&#39; smiled.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;But you could be! You could look after her! She&#39;ll have some trouble in the future. You know, she&#39;ll find this body in the park... She&#39;ll be really upset.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You bulged your eyes out.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;How... How do you know?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

But she didn&#39;t answer you. The door to your room opened and two toddlers showed up. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; calmly greeted your mother. You could feel the distance already established between them. It looked sad. You were sure that a little girl was excited to see her mom, but she told her to not shout enough. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; seriously nodded. He was afraid of your mother.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; is going home,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; the little &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; with a real grief.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Alone?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; Your mother frowned. &lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;I thought we agreed with your mom that she will come for you. There is a big street on your way home, it&#39;s too dangerous.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

The little boy blushed helplessly.

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;I will be very careful,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he promised quietly.

Your mother looked conflicted. Your father shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;OK, time for to go,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said and opened the door. 

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, he&#39;s leaving,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; aunt &#39;&#39;Rita&#39;&#39; said to you, smiling. &lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;He should discover something before he would leave...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

You looked at her. Yes, you remembered this. Your father discovered &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; wounds. But he was opening the door right now!

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;They need guardian angel now.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;[[You interfered.|Interfere]] &lt;&lt;forceful $display&gt;&gt;

She was waiting for your reaction. You bit your lips. You knew that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; needed help. You remembered his damages, his wounds. Did those dreams shape the alternative reality, where you were a girl? You always thought that &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; simply brainwashed the people... But maybe the Parity reached deeper, to the time itself?

You couldn&#39;t risk. 

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Dad, look at him!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you exclaimed.

Nobody reacted, but you felt that something happened. Everything got darker, quieter. You looked around, suddenly scared. You felt you did something wrong, something that would have grave consequences.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t worry, little angel,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;Rita&#39;&#39; said to you with really creepy smile on her face. &lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;You will practice... After three days you will have another chance!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

Your father looked at &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, then at his watch. He sighed.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Come on, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, I&#39;ll walk you home. I will go to cemetery tomorrow.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

The little boy smiled lightly. Your mother looked surprised. Your father waited until &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; tied his shoes. Then he put his hand on the boy&#39;s shoulder. That was a friendly gesture, but &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; hissed in pain. Your father looked at him and you saw that he was connecting the dots. A hoodie during the hot, summer day. Being quiet even more than usual. The paleness on the face.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said quietly. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;Could you take your shirt off, please?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You looked at the little boy who started to shake. Your parents both kneeled next to him and delicately took off his hoodie and shirt. Little &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; gasped. It looked like...&lt;/p&gt;[[...he had no healthy place on his back.|Justin&#39;s wounds]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="219" name="Don&#39;t interfere" tags="" position="25349,865" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $backto = &quot;Don&#39;t interfere&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $player.allowChangeApproach==1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $player.changeApproach = &quot;Careful&quot;&gt;&gt;

But maybe the Parity reached deeper, to the time itself?

You did nothing. It was a dream. You kept repeating yourself that. You wouldn&#39;t interfere. It was too dangerous.

Your father looked at &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, then at his watch. He sighed.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Come on, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, I&#39;ll walk you home. I will go to cemetery tomorrow.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said quietly. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;Could you take your shirt off, please?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;Rita&#39;&#39; was looking at you, disappointed.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Your father is better angel guardian than you, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You ignored her. You looked at the little boy who started to shake. Your parents both kneeled next to him and delicately took off his hoodie and shirt. Little &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; gasped. It looked like...&lt;/p&gt;[[...he had no healthy place on his back.|Justin&#39;s wounds]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="220" name="Justin&#39;s wounds" tags="" position="25223,716" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; back was covered by bruises. Some of them were old, but most of them were fresh. You couldn&#39;t understand how this boy could even stand. Your parents exchanged glances. You knew how this situation was handled, so you didn&#39;t listen carefully. They decided to call &#39;&#39;Kate&#39;&#39;, uncle &#39;&#39;Stan&#39;s&#39;&#39; wife, who was a doctor. There was a discussion between the adults about what they should do. They knew the law, they should report it to the police, but your mother as a social worker knew that the government wanted to protect families what meant that there was a little chance that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; would be taken from his parents. Besides, in the poverty and violence in your district, most children would be in an orphanage if the law was respected strictly. They made the x-ray and it turned out that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; had no permanent damages, but he should lie down for a week or two. It was impossible to get him a place in the hospital. His return to the flat was a bad idea too, as his unemployed father was there all the time.

The solution was strange to you, considering how your mother was strict and lawful. She and &#39;&#39;Kate&#39;&#39; talked with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; mother and warned her that this situation couldn&#39;t be repeated or she would lose benefit. It turned out that threat worked, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; father didn&#39;t raise his hand on his son until his death 4 years later. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; remained with your family for two weeks for a total recovery.

You remembered that all. You looked at two toddlers who were sitting next to each other and holding hands. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was completely still and calm, but you saw this cold look you saw sometimes in all your childhood friends. There was something unnatural in this gaze without any emotion. When &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; had it, it was an introduction to cold fury. You didn&#39;t see &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; erupting yet and you didn&#39;t want to. 

Little &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was as supportive as you were. She was a brave kid. You saw that she was shocked and terrified, but still, she did her best to cheer her friend up.

And it was her who solved the biggest problem of this day. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was stubborn. It would be a key to his success in later life, but then it caused trouble. He didn&#39;t want to take your bed and nothing could persuade him. He didn&#39;t want to be anyone&#39;s trouble. He just stood with a stern face. &lt;/p&gt;[[The solution.|Best friends forever]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="221" name="Best friends forever" tags="" position="25429,722" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; solved the deadlock in the way you did so many years ago. She pulled the mattress off her own bed.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;We will both sleep on the floor!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she exclaimed with the serious face that was a comic caricature of your mother&#39;s mood. The adults laughed. Even &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; smiled a little.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Do you accept it, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; your father asked. The little boy blushed helplessly and noded. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Great. So put your pijama on and lie on your stomach, ok? &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, let&#39;s give a man a little privacy.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

Everyone left the room. You followed them. You didn&#39;t want to see the wounds again. Besides, you knew what would happen next. Little &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; cried. There were tears of sadness and compassion, but she was happy that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; would stay. Both parents hugged her and kissed her. And then her mother spoke the words she never repeated:

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;I am proud of you.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Time sped up. Suddenly was an evening and little &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; laid next to &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. Even if he was sleeping earlier, now his eyes were wide opened.

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s strange,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. &lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;Can... Can we pretend we are brother and sister? It will be less strange to me.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

The little girl giggled.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure we can! But brothers and sisters must argue and fight.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;Some of them don&#39;t.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You see? You are already arguing! You&#39;ll be the best brother I ever have!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Two toddlers giggled. You looked at them smiling.

She was silent. She was occasionally pulling her trousers up. Fortunately for her, she wore rather baggy combat pants. You could only imagine how uncomfortable it would be wearing the typical, tight girl trousers.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; lived in a block of flats. Her flat was on the fourth floor. You usually took the stairs, but &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; called the elevator. She avoided eye contact. You realized it was the longest time she hadn’t said a word in your presence.

The elevator was old and rattling. You didn&#39;t like it. When you were a child, you were afraid of it, and it took a role in your nightmares. You felt relief when it stopped on the right floor.

Of course, you noticed the palm branch which was placed behind the pipe next to the door to the flat. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;
s&#39;&#39; parents were Catholic zealots. The branch, looking very out of place on the chipped, shabby staircase, welcomed Jesus Christ, if the Savior was passing-by. 

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; spent a moment looking for keys. She was nervous. Muttering swear words, she finally opened the door and let you in.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Give me a moment,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said quietly. She apparently was ashamed of her new voice. She went to the bathroom and closed the door.&lt;/p&gt;[[You stayed close.|Wait for Oliver]] &lt;&lt;careful $display&gt;&gt;

As she once said, books were good for people who wanted to know more. Her parents thought they knew everything.

You listened carefully. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; breathed heavily. You heard some sobs, then mumbled swear words.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; room was the opposite of her parents&#39; place. It was empty and ascetic.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; scoffed.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Such a prude! Is it something you haven&#39;t seen before? You must be very shy at showers.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $player.Condition gt 0 and $player.Popularity gt 0 or $player.Condition gte 2 or $player.Popularity gte 2&gt;&gt;You weren&#39;t. You were quite proud of the size of your cock.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Well, you were, but it wasn&#39;t important.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; sighed.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Nothing fits. Girl panties are quite tight in the front, you know.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Use the towel!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you suggested.

&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, finally you are useful.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Wait for Oliver&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;Let&#39;s sit down in the kitchen.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The kitchen was tiny, but there were two wobbly chairs. There was also a painting of Our Lady Nursing, which (as &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; parents believed) protected from hunger.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; came back after a few moments with a purple towel wrapped around her waist. She lit a cigarette.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;She will live.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; But she opened the window and stood next to it. She was bothered.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;So, the best day of my life just became fucked up,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I wonder...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;[[&quot;...if it was you or me?&quot;|It was you or me]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="226" name="Stare at her cock" tags="" position="10793,583" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $oliverCock= true&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You stared at her cock. It was something that looked totally out of place. You couldn&#39;t say that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; had killer legs. She was more thin and tall than curvy. But she shaved her legs, and she had some hips. This cock looked like it had been photoshopped onto to her. And, as you noticed, it was big.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; touched it and it bounced. It was half erect, and her balls seemed heavy.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s weird,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said with disgust. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;And it&#39;s... alive. All the way here I had the impression that I had some parasyte attached. You know, pressed by my panties and trousers...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

She shivered then breathed heavily.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Ok, that&#39;s weirder. Talking with you about my cock. My cock,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she repeated, like she couldn&#39;t believe it. You realized that you had stared at her manhood longer than you probably should. You&#39;d never looked so carefully at a cock other than yours. You turned around.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, you know... They are quite autonomous. You know, the temperature, your mood... Your thoughts, of course...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; You cleared your throat. You both felt the awkwardness of this situation.

She sighed.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Nothing fits to cover it. Girl panties are quite tight in the front, you know.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You can use the towel,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you suggested.

She nodded.

&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Wait for Oliver&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Wait for me in the kitchen,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said.

You looked surprised.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Are you high?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you asked. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I didn&#39;t make any deals with &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; lately. You must’ve fucked up something.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It grew after you tried to be funny,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said pointing at her groin. She looked at you. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t be funny. People get hurt when you try to be funny.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She slowly restored her balance. That was a good sign. The sudden tune of her phone interrupted the conversation. Tom Waits, who sounded like the Cookie Monster was announcing to the world that God was away for business. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; grabbed  the phones from the bathroom and rejected the call.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;This whole ritual... Fuck &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;! She said that this variant should work! That bitch set me up!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;What are you thinking?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she asked.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You shrugged. It wasn&#39;t a good time to tell her.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;A lot happened.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;But it was you who mentioned the shemale category, not me.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she muttered. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;So, do you think &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; looks like a living wet dream because she wanted to?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You shrugged. You&#39;d never thought about that.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; snorted.

Stupid &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. And you were stupid too.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Damn it! You were losing your mind because of this stress and your best friend was a little help! Ok, she... he... Damn it! He. You saw his dick, for Christ&#39;s sake! It was a rather poor level of gender identity in the twenty-first century, but you needed something. He.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You felt bad about this quarrel. You weren&#39;t more sure than you had been before you started it. &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; didn&#39;t change you during school, but she didn&#39;t change any of the boys. Something was in motion, but you didn&#39;t have the slightest idea what to do about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;After school you went home. You climbed on the fourth floor to your flat. You heard muffled, but still loud music. Your father had to finish his big project and now he was celebrating. It was the whole ritual, but the central point was watching the remastered version of the concert Led Zeppelin played at Madison Square Garden in 1973. You could probably tell the course of the concert minute after minute. 

You opened the door and you were stunned by &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; in HD quality. You smelled also the delicious aroma from the kitchen. Your father cooked well.

As the iron rule of your father claimed: &quot;No talking when Zeppelin is playing&quot;, you just waved him and went to your room. Then the three things happened that shocked you completely.

First thing, it wasn&#39;t your room. You looked at the light-blue walls and white furniture. There was a big stuffed unicorn laying on your bed. The bedding was purple. And the notebook was pink. It was definitely a girly room.

Second thing, your father paused the concert to talk with you. It was probably the scariest thing, as you didn&#39;t remember a single moment like that.

Finally, he gently kissed you on the cheek and said:

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello, sweetie. Can you take your clothes off a dryer? Dinner in the minute.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He never called you &quot;sweetie&quot; in your whole life.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, dad,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you mumbled. You took off your backpack, thunderstruck. You went to the bathroom and washed your hand. Then you look at the dryer.

You didn&#39;t recognize the clothes that hung there. No, wait. It was a t-shirt with the Jurassic Park logo you bought at the convention last year. But you remembered it as black, this one&#39;s color was more like graphite. And it was smaller. And, as you pulled it up, it was definitely a women&#39;s t-shirt.

You looked at the lingerie that was still drying. Some of these panties and bras belonged to your mother, but you saw only your father&#39;s boxers and socks. So, you assumed, the rest was yours. You looked at those lacy bras, panties, and colorful socks. You saw even a pair of a black thong. 

You took those girl clothes to the bowl and take them to the room. You sat on the chair, still shocked. Of course, you knew what that meant. Then you heard your father saying:

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;[[...dinner&#39;s waiting!|Dinner with dad]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="237" name="Oliver transformed" tags="" position="14743,445" size="100,100">&lt;p&gt;&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Play basketball&quot;) and not visited(&quot;Martha kicks ass&quot;)&gt;&gt;But you didn&#39;t let him go.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;When you came back, it turned out that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; wanted to blow off the last lesson. For your classmates it was very funny, because they assumed that after his full transformation he&#39;d spend the rest of the day jerking off.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $oliverCock == true or visited(&quot;Interrupt sex&quot;) or visited(&quot;Hide&quot;) or visited(&quot;Take my chances&quot;)&gt;&gt;You heard and experienced today enough to have some thoughts about the rumors about the first cock you&#39;d see. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; behavior in the room was suspicious. His current behavior even more. Did he wanted to take advantage of you? Being &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; slut sounded only a little better than being &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; slut.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Where are you going?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; stopped and turned around. You saw he was anxious. He smiled wryly.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I have some business in the town.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Play basketball&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Why did you lie, then?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell, then?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

He shrugged. 

&lt;&lt;if $lieToOliver==true&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know. Maybe because of the same reasons you lied to me yesterday when I asked you to imagine my changes. Because I didn&#39;t want you to know. Look, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.

He winced. He looked at his watch.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You have to wait, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. As you currently can survive without my constant help, I need to take care of other innocent souls. I&#39;ll catch you later.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ll pick up this call. I swear, if it&#39;s some bitch from a call center... Wait a moment.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; She said. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes? Oh! Hi, &lt;&lt;textbox &quot;$they.dorothyName&quot; &quot;Dorothy&quot;&gt;&gt;! What&#39;s up? Long story... I wanted to save &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; balls and I ended up with my own set... Yes, he&#39;s here... She says &quot;hi&quot;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she told you. Your eyes bulged out. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Listen, I&#39;ll call you back. We just finished measuring our cocks, you know, boy stuff... Yeah, I love you too... Fuck off! I don&#39;t do that! Yeah, see ya!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You were shocked.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;How?!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you bubbled.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;She used to be in &#39;&#39;Rosset&#39;s&#39;&#39;, right?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Last year!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;When a rose stings you, you can&#39;t be unstung. Maybe. I don&#39;t know.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; She put her hand on her groin. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;But I&#39;m glad she remembers. Maybe it would be... you know... less weird if you have a friend to talk to. She&#39;s a good listener.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You sighed.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;She always has been,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you admitted.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You guys still don&#39;t talk?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You shook your head.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Listen, I don&#39;t really want to talk about this. You have a lot to process... And, honestly, me too. It&#39;s been a long day that I want to end.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She smiled weakly. 

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I won&#39;t hug you. If this towel fell off it would be awkward... But thank you for coming here.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You put your hand out. She hesitated for a moment and put out hers. You shook hands. 

You turned around, but you stopped. You looked at &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;How did she know you transformed?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She smiled.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;My social media username changed. I&#39;m &lt;&lt;textbox &quot;$they.oliviaMaleName&quot; &quot;Olivier&quot;&gt;&gt; now.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Nice name.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Not too bad.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You said goodbye... &lt;/p&gt;[[...and went home.|Courtain room]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="239" name="2nd day school" tags="" position="12576,500" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest of night passed peacefully. To your surprise, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was waiting for you. She was now taller than you. She could be the same height as &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, but since she was slim she looked even taller. She had no breasts and a little hair on her face. She was smiling wryly.

Her clothes were very similar to those she usually wore, but &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; had grown 15 centimeters, so you said:

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I see you took a chance to change your style.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Why would I change perfection?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You looked at her carefully.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;How you doin&#39;?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Good, I think. It&#39;s weird. It&#39;s new. I don&#39;t really feel like myself... But I think it&#39;ll pass. I am still mad at &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You put your hand on her shoulder to comfort her. That was odd since she was tall now. You knew that behind that calm voice and short sentences she hid many emotions. But it was &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, she couldn&#39;t speak normally about her feelings. She was joking until something triggered her, then she exploded. The things she just said were probably the closest to an attempt to communicate her feelings. You smiled at her.

&lt;&lt;if not visited(&quot;Call Olivia&quot;)&gt;&gt;She told you her dream.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I was in a room where I was playing poker. There was &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; there. And &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39;. That was weird. Our new sweet little girl was naked. Well, let me tell you, she&#39;ll stuff her bra. She took one of these poker chips and... Don&#39;t laugh... She rubbed it against her cunt! &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; was pleased, you could tell! Then &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; went behind some curtain and that demonic bitch disappeared! She barely looked at me!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Then she asked about your dream.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;She asked you about your dream.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $player.Privacy gte 1&gt;&gt;You told her about it, but you didn&#39;t go into detail. You didn&#39;t feel you could talk with her openly about it. There were some things you could only process alone.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You felt a great relief that you could talk about it with somebody. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; wasn&#39;t the best listener, but she believed your every word. That had to be enough.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $beAgirl==true&gt;&gt;There was one thought that bugged you.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;How do you perform this ritual?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you asked.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; smiled.

&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Happier as a girl&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I thought you&#39;d ask.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah. I can join. Besides, we won&#39;t have a repeat from yesterday. I can find the knife somewhere.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; 

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; sighed.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Unfortunately, it&#39;s not so simple,&quot;&lt;/span&gt;  she said. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;This ritual lasts six days. &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; sucks your blood as the finale. Sorry, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s all your fault, you know that, right?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $robertPlans == true&gt;&gt;She sighed. 

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, and I&#39;ve been punished, haven&#39;t I?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You snorted.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Because you are going to be a guy?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you sneered. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t be ridiculous. You will be you, still. I would be some fucking whore. I&#39;ll lose everything! I&#39;ll lose my mind! Maybe my soul!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You don&#39;t know that. I&#39;ve fucked up the ritual. He clearly fucked it up too. If he didn&#39;t, you&#39;d be his whore yesterday and I&#39;d look for a way to get you out of that shit.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Promise?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Promise what?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;That you&#39;d look for a way to get me out of that shit.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; rolled her eyes.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Like I need to promise! Of course I&#39;d do that! Seriously, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;!

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Stop whining. You didn&#39;t give me the slightest idea you could be interested in turning into a girl. Never. So I assumed that when there was a plot against you, I&#39;d defend you. I&#39;m not going to apologize for that! If you want a pussy, there is a year ahead of you.

Students that knew &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; were looking at her with wide eyes as they passed by. The rumors had spread as her social media accounts changed.

You expected she would yell at &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; the first second she saw her in the school corridor, but she ignored her completely.

You couldn&#39;t focus on &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; anymore. You had your own plot. Your phone buzzed. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;...&lt;/p&gt;[[...sent you some photos.|Dick pics]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="240" name="Dick pics" tags="" position="12590,721" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;angerScene $auntie&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;displaytext&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;lessanger $auntie&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You clicked on the notification from &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.

When it finally loaded you winced with disgust. You’d just gotten the first dick pics in your life, and you understood completely why so many women were traumatized by that.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;What the fuck?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

It was an ordinary photo taken by phone. No proper light, no perspective, no context. It was pure vulgarity, if something so dirty could be pure in any sense. His cock was erect and &lt;&lt;if $player.Condition lte 1&gt;&gt;much bigger&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;a little bigger than yours&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;, but &lt;&lt;if $oliverCock==true&gt;&gt;smaller&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;probably smaller&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; than &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39;. You didn&#39;t know what to say.&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $oliverCock==true and $angerScene ==1&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But you kept thinking about &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; cock. You didn&#39;t want her to  send you such pictures (of course), but you were sure that her dick would look better than this.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;

You looked at &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. He smiled, evidently pleased with himself. He clearly waited for your reaction, but after a while, you saw disappointment on his face, then anger.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Something happened?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; asked.&lt;/p&gt;[[You showed her.|Show it Olivia]] &lt;&lt;flashy $display&gt;&gt;

Her eyes bulged out. Then she laughed loudly.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Come on, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she exclaimed. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re calling this a cock? Mine is far larger and I don&#39;t send photos of it to random people!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Of course, such a statement drew attention. Students looked in her and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; direction. The jock blushed furiously.

People wanted to know the details. When &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; explained that he sent those photos, not to her, but to you, a guy, there were more comments and laughs. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; hadn’t gotten used to being the object of jokes. He retreated and didn&#39;t show up again until the bell rang.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You know you humiliated him, right?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you asked her.

She shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Really? Girls are teasing other girls with smaller tits all the time, you know. Boys too. I heard it constantly since middle school.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Everyone cansee girls&#39; boobs. The size of a penis is... well... a private thing.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She snorted.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Double standards.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You sighed. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was acting even more impulsive than usual during her changes. That was another thing you should think about.&lt;/p&gt;[[One of many things worthy to be considered.|Reflections after second dream]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="242" name="Don&#39;t show" tags="" position="12733,495" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $backto = &quot;Don&#39;t show&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $player.allowChangeApproach==1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $player.changeApproach = &quot;Careful&quot;&gt;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Nevermind.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

But it wasn&#39;t over. When you were taking the books from your locker, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; came. His grin was creepy as always. You noticed that his walk had changed. He was slouching and moving sneakily. With his posture, it looked grotesque.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;So, what do you think?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he asked sheepishly. You looked at him, surprised. Yes, evidently he was shy when he asked about the photo of his dick. 

You snorted.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;What do I think?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you repeated. Damn, he was holding his breath! &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I think that you are sick, man.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

The disappointment on his face was comical.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;If you need an opinion about your dick from a guy maybe you should ask some gays about it? &#39;&#39;Adam&#39;&#39; from senior year...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

But you didn&#39;t have a chance to finish the sentence about &#39;&#39;Adam&#39;&#39; from senior year. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; face turned pale, then darkened. He pulled a face so wild that he barely looked like a human being. He grabbed you and pulled you up on the wall so hard that you almost blacked out. He started to shake you.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not a fag! Never... Never was... Never will!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he shouted. &lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;You stupid bitch! Never say that again! Never think that again! I&#39;d know! I will fucking kill you!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He was breathing heavily. He released you.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;You are mine, bitch. You&#39;ll beg to suck this cock!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He hit a locker next to you so hard that it dented. Then he left without a word.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Wow,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said to yourself. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Twenty first century.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

On the way to class you had a lot to...&lt;/p&gt;[[...think about.|Reflections after second dream]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="243" name="First break" tags="" position="13150,538" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;&lt;if $relations.Boys lte 2&gt;&gt;You felt your classmates&#39; eyes on you during the lesson. Their nasty comments focused on &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, but it was a matter of time until they&#39;d turn to you. 

The first offense you heard merged bullying her and bullying you.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I hope you will grow bigger tits than &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. She lowers the average.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You snorted.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Keep talking like that. After yesterday I&#39;m pretty sure that &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; hunts fuckers like you. I&#39;ve never felt safer.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

But they didn&#39;t give up. You kept hearing how you were a pathetic sissy and faggot. They didn&#39;t buy another bra, but this time &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; didn&#39;t stop the bullying, so they were taking their fear out on you.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; accidentally added fuel to the fire when she spread out that you bought VIP tickets for the &quot;Celtic Maidens&quot; concert this Friday. Your classmates pretended relief.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;Hey, &lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, good taste! My girlfriend is going to that concert too. All chicks love &quot;Celtic Maidens&quot;!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

For everyone, this was a clear sign that you&#39;d become &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; bitch.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;So, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, are you ready for your first time fucking her without a strap-on?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

But they met their match.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m always ready! I&#39;ll eat your pussy today!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

And every time she heard comments she was smacking her lips loudly with a grin worthy of Hannibal Lecter. It turned out to be an effective way to disconcert them.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;You felt your classmates&#39; eyes on you during the lesson. The transformation of &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was a short relief. Some guys already called &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; his male name. The name &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; seemed to suit her better now. But as she&#39;d become a boy, it was certain that somebody would be hugged. It was nearly impossible to think that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; would turn back to equalize the number of boys and girls. &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $logPrologue.PopularityBoys lte 2&gt;&gt;It was odd, but after the math lesson your popularity seemed to grow somehow. Nobody tormented you like yesterday.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Will this ever end?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; one of your classmates sighed.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe she will hug &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;... That would be fair.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Of course, such a comment was spoken quietly, when the jock wasn&#39;t around.

But some comments regarded you. They put it delicately, but, as you were close with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, some of your classmates agreed it would be easier for you to be a girl with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; on your side.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you chuckled. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I see you didn’t only nominate me to be a girl, but you already picked a boyfriend for me. No one is interested?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;No offence, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, but it would be weird to bang a chick who used to be a guy.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, like you&#39;d never fuck &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, if you had a chance!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you snapped back.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $investigation.contains(&quot;Caroline&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;//But some guys weren&#39;t prejudiced against having sex with a girl who once was a boy.

It was quite popular among people your age, especially among girls. Well, that was the sign of your times. Young people in your country either learned Korean and Japanese and tried to draw their own manga, or they were into folk music, and Celtic folk was the best. Slavic pride was awakened by the success of CD Projekt and Netflix&#39;s &quot;The Witcher&quot;, but the Slavic folk music wasn&#39;t as good as Irish tunes. Adding the fact that Ireland was a popular country to emigrate to, the Green Island seemed to be close.

The &quot;Celtic Maidens&quot; concert in your city was an important event. Maybe it wasn&#39;t top league music, but the tickets quickly sold out. You begged your father to buy you and your friends&#39; tickets. Of course, he played it in his own wicked way. When you were 16, your father told you that you were mature enough to earn money for your hobbies. So he bought 6 tickets for all of you, but you were the only one who actually had to work to bring him the money back for your ticket.

As the concert would be this Friday, many girls in your school asked you to resell the ticket to them. 

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sorry, but I don&#39;t have more tickets. Ask &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, she got two and she doesn&#39;t have a date,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said.

&lt;&lt;if $relations.Girls gte 2&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, I asked her already,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; your classmate said and sighed. &lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;She sold it already. But what about your date? You broke up with... What was her name...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. Yeah. But I didn&#39;t take back the ticket from her. She’ll go with us.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Wow, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. Such a generous break-up present. And she treated you awfully, from I remember.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

It looked like you could receive a lot of compassion as long as you had the ticket for this concert. &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $logPrologue.PopularityBoys lte 2&gt;&gt;Generally, and oddly, after the math lesson your popularity seemed to somehow grow. Girls treated you better.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;After this declaration, the girls stopped being nice to you. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; messed with some of them, but you knew she sold her ticket a long time ago.

The girls’ jealousy caused them to be as horrible as the boys usually were. So you heard about how shitty the music you listened to is, that you would be raped at this concert as all the men here were homo, and that you had to buy those tickets to bribe some people to hang out with you.

You kind of got used to the comments, but you were sure that if you were more popular, the same girls would say that it is sweet that there was a boy who listened to such good music.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $investigation.contains(&quot;Robert&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;//You noticed that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;...//&lt;/p&gt;[[...was sneaking away.|Robert and the mirror]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;[[You went to the lecture.|The project]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="245" name="The project" tags="" position="13692,422" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For your third lesson of the day, you went to the gym. Your teacher said that you&#39;d have some historical lecture with a guy from the Institute of National Remembrance. There were also three other classes, all with a humanistic profile. It was going to be a loose lesson of history with some boring PowerPoint presentation.

You sat down on the floor. The speaker was already there. Surprisingly, he was young and dressed casually. He smiled at you with the placable smile of a former convict of the education system who still remembered how to be a high school student.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Ok, I think we’ll start,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said and cleared his throat. He introduced himself, but nobody cared. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I was told that you are the class with a humanistic profile, so I assume you are interested in history... Or at least a good grade from the history exam. Your school joined our project about the local places of remembrance. Your district is very interesting because many places remain unknown. Some of you literally live in graveyards. More specifically, above the mass graves of the victims of the Communist regime.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

He showed you some photos. They were of skulls extracted from under the pavement. There were scratched inscriptions in old bricks in the cluttered basements. The rusted door covered with sheet metal thrown in the trash. Then he showed you a picture of the upper half of a human skeleton. To reveal it the archeologists had to take off the pavement. Under the waist was a rusted bench.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Do you recognize this place?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he asked. Students ignored him completely. Most of them scrolled on their phones or kept staring into space.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;This is our school.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

The loud and calm tone of &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; voice woke everyone up. Students looked at the board.

The speaker smiled.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Thank you. This skeleton is still here. The rest of this man lays in a private plot. We tried to get a warrant, but until then you&#39;ll have him... or her, of course. The law forbids the exhumation of incomplete remains if there is a chance to perform a complete exhumation.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;So... You dug him up and then... put him back?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

He smiled wider.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Exactly. Thank you for the summary. This is the edge of your schoolyard.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; looked shocked. You hadn’t  seen her so moved since... Well, a long time.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sadly, it&#39;s not an exception. It&#39;s common here. This district gained importance because of the new line of the subway. The developers build new housing estates, and they renovate old buildings. Those who invest their money here don&#39;t want delays. They don&#39;t report bones and other objects the workers have found. And people who want to move here don&#39;t want to live on a former mass grave... So, the potential places of remembrance are being destroyed every day, because some rich people want to be richer sooner rather than later, and some other people are afraid of living in potentially haunted places.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

He chuckled because of this last comment, but students didn&#39;t join him. In &#39;&#39;Rosset High School&#39;&#39; no one made fun of haunted buildings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $investigation.contains(&quot;Olivier&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;//You saw &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; shivered. She looked at her arms. They were becoming more muscular and they were covered with quite thick hair. She was looking at her changes with a mix of disbelief and fascination.//&lt;/p&gt;[[She looked practically like a boy now.|The transformation of Olivia]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;[[The long break.|Break outside]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="246" name="Break outside" tags="" position="14204,415" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the fifth lesson there was a long break that lasted 20 minutes. The April sun encouraged most students to go to the schoolyard. &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if not visited(&quot;Sit on the bench&quot;)&gt;&gt;The playing field was a quite small, graveled square. However, while most of the schools in the city were renovated, the cracked concrete and rusty fences reminded one of the 1990s or even the Communist era. No one cut the weeds that wriggled through old, damaged benches. Insects were everywhere, swarming in their unknown purposes.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt; Young grass covered the ground that could hide mass graves. Students, even those present at the lecture, ignored that possibility completely. They sat everywhere.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; borrowed the basketball from the coach. He dribbled with skill. You remembered that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; played on the school team in middle school. As a boy he was much taller, and evidently he enjoyed it when he jumped and threw a ball into the basket.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hey, you midget!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he exclaimed. He was now ten centimeters taller than you. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviahalffemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Wanna play?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;if $investigation.contains(&quot;Martha&quot;)&gt;&gt;[[You decided to follow her.|Martha&#39;s wounds]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;[[You played basketball.|Play basketball]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="247" name="Play basketball" tags="" position="14474,520" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $relations.Olivia=$relations.Olivia+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;angerScene $auntie&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;displaytext&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;lessanger $auntie&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You smiled.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;For the Shire!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

In the beginning, you just threw a ball alternately. It was a close game. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; had a problem with accuracy, because his arms were much longer and stronger. But with every round, he got more and more self-confidence.

Some students from other classes decided to join you. You split in two teams and you were playing against &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. Then things got more interesting.

&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Play aggressively&quot;) or $approaches.contains(2) and $approaches.contains(5) or $approaches.contains(6)&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was taller and stronger than you, but his body was new for him. He was clumsy. You could swing him easily. He was swearing a lot, but he enjoyed the game.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You tried your best. You had your skills, you had your tactics. But he was just too big and strong! He swung you easily. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; enjoyed the game. He got more comfortable with his new body. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $oliverCock==true&gt;&gt;You couldn&#39;t help but admire him now. How he was adjusting to the new situation, but still remaining his old self. He was a boy now, and the handsome boy. He got this charm... And you couldn&#39;t about what was hiding in his pants. In the game you accidentally touch it and it wasn&#39;t the unpleasant feeling.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $investigation.contains(&quot;Martha&quot;)&gt;&gt;//Then you noticed that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was walking in the direction where &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; went earlier.// &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $mirrorBreak == false&gt;&gt;//His head was bandaged.//&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $investigation.contains(&quot;Robert&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;//Then you noticed that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was walking behind the school building.

He shook his hands with other players and left. But you realized that he didn&#39;t go to a gym, to showers. He went directly to the school&#39;s main entrance.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;You... won&#39;t... touch me... again, &quot;&lt;/span&gt; she squeezed through clenched teeth. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Never.

He yelped something desperately. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; slowly calmed down. Then she made some gesture and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; sighed with relief. He was breathing heavily, lying in rubbish.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Look at you,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; hissed. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;You son of the bitch!

She kicked him in the ribs, but after the pain, he felt earlier he didn&#39;t even wince. She did. She forgot about her own leg.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;You pissed your pants anyway,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she added mercilessly. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;But it&#39;s not the worst part. I want you to hear it. Would you listen?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;I... I want to hear it.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She smiled.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Good boy. You probably think, you sexist pig, that only women can be degraded to fuck toys. You are wrong. &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; loves equality.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You... It was true what did you say to him about this sex slavery?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She giggled.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;More or less,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said wryly. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Now excuse me, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. That was exhausting to me also. Good luck. You&#39;ll need it.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Tick-tock, tick-tock...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; rummaged in the pieces of the broken mirror. You could barely use another word to describe his actions. He was desperate.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hey, what are you doing here, you perv?!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you heard some voice shout. A senior year girl evidently wanted to use the restroom. She passed you by, then she backed off, looking at you shocked. You smiled sarcastically. She left quickly.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Then &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; screamed. You jumped. In his cry sounded pure despair. You looked at him again.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He desperately tried to back off, but he seemed to be held by some force. He couldn&#39;t even close his eyes.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

So you did the same as him. You took your shirt off and looked for a bigger piece. It wasn&#39;t easy. The mirror had been smashed into thousands of fragments. Most of them were tiny. But you eventually found one which looked promising. You wrapped your shirt around it and put it into your backpack.

You looked ridiculous. The dress was too small, too tight. The bra was covered with nothing. The hair on your chest compared awfully with the flawless of your &lt;&lt;print $braOn&gt;&gt;. Your half-erected penis tucked helplessly in your &lt;&lt;print $pantiesOn&gt;&gt;. There was nothing girly in you. Everyone would laugh at you if they saw you.

But that was going to change. That thought made your cock tingled. You rubbed it through the softness of your panties. If you understood well, the reality shifted already. For everyone that knew you you didn&#39;t have other clothes. It was natural for them to see you in them. The wave of pleasure went through your body.

You had to examine this. You went to the door. You bit your lips, excited and a little worried. You opened it. You walked into the hall, barefoot, only wearing a dress and feminine lingerie. You came to the kitchen where your parents sat. They looked at you but didn&#39;t react. It was good, because your poor penis, tucked in the tight panties, was started to pull out, erecting. You poured the water into a glass. Your heart raced. You turned back and leaned against the sink, so you stood in a front of your parents. 

&lt;&lt;if $socksOn.length ==0&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, don&#39;t go barefoot,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; your mother said. &lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;ll catch a cold.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, it&#39;s too cold for a dress yet,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; your mother said.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Your father smiled.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t get ill again for a weekend, sweetie. You won&#39;t forgive yourself.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

The pouring of water was a good idea. Your throat was suddenly dry. You drank it down in one go. Then you went to your room, grinning like a maniac. 

You threw on the bed, biting your lip. The fresh and cold bedding was tingling you. They looked at you and saw a girl! They saw you, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;! You could go outside in the girliest clothes and you&#39;d be treated as a girl. As a young woman.

It was too much for you. You grabbed your cock and started to stroke it furiously. You&#39;d never felt like that. It was better than weed you smoke with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. You wanted to scream, you wanted to laugh, you wanted to cry. The orgasm you finally felt was an explosion of bliss. You panted, still grinning. Wow. If that was your last male orgasm (that thought tingled your cock again), it was worthed to remember.

But it wasn&#39;t. This evening was for you the marathon of masturbation. Even if you tried to do something else, you were easily distracted by any trigger. Then you were in your bed again, rubbing your lingerie and stroking your cock, imagining how it would look tomorrow when you&#39;d have your new, more accurate equipment between your legs. You closed your eyes so hard they were itching. You were thinking about sex in your new role. You imagined being penetrated by a big cock, caressing by a man who loved you, who cared about you. &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $oliverCock==true and $angerScene ==1&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

He blinked. Then he said: 

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;What the fuck are you talking about?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

So you started to talk. You told about your suspicious and about the thoughts you had during this day.

He was listening. His face was calm, but you knew him too well. It was that cold fury that you observed sometimes in all three of your childhood friends.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Let me sum up: I pretended to fuck up the ritual, because I wanted to be a guy and as one I decided it have obiedent whore so I lured you to my flat just to show you my dick.

Did I miss something, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He was angry. He was barely able to speak. He was shivering like during some seizure.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Even if you didn&#39;t do that, you act that I have a right to think like that!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Then &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; exploded.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Fuck you!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he shouted. He came closer. You were sure he&#39;d hit you, but he just grabbed you. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Fuck you! Fuck you, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;! I don&#39;t want to screw you! I don&#39;t want to see you right now! I don&#39;t want to know you right now! You fucking shit! You ungrateful bastard! You fucking egoist! You! Your rights!

You were speechless for a moment. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; didn&#39;t give you time to answer. He turned around. 

You stood for a while, doubtful. Did you really misjudge him? Everything was so fucked up. 

You felt bad. 

You felt unsafe.

You didn&#39;t control the situation. 

You were scared. 

You were uncertain. 

You were extremaly tired.

You wanted to shout. 

You wanted to cry. 

You wanted to disappear.

You couldn&#39;t find the accurate words. You were so overwhelmed. You looked at him helplessly. Then you did something that surprised, even more, you than him.

You burst into tears.

You were crying loudly, hysterically. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; after the moment of the hesitation hugged you. He was taller than you, so his arms comforted you. You wanted to say to him how did you felt. How you tried to be brave. How you tried to endure the Parity and all thoughts that &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; put into your head. How you needed a friend right now.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I know... I know...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he was repeating but he knew nothing. But what he did, how he held you, was helping.

You calmed down after two or three minutes. You backed off and breath heavily.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m tired repeating it to you, but clearly I have to,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m on your side. I&#39;m your friend. I don&#39;t let anybody or anything to harm you.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I know, I know... Just... promise me one thing. Don&#39;t do anything behind my back. Don&#39;t disappear because you had some marvelous plan. I can handle a lot... But not in the situations when you keep surprising me.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;... &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he looked at you quickly, but you pretended to not notice. In fact, you started a fight, then bursted into tears, when you found out it was he who was right. That was very feminine matter.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I will pick you up and walk you home.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he proposed.

You shook your head.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;No need, thanks. I have to think,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you mumbled. 

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I can shut up. I don&#39;t want you to be alone.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You snorted.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You never shut up, you can&#39;t do this. No, seriously. You have... a lot to think about too. Bye.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You pulled out your hand for goodbye, but he hugged you again and kissed you on the cheek.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Take care.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He ran off and you came back to school.&lt;/p&gt;[[Later.|Thursday plans]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="259" name="Touch the cards" tags="" position="12043,732" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $backto = &quot;Touch the cards&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $player.allowChangeApproach==1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $player.changeApproach = &quot;Clever&quot;&gt;&gt;

At least, not yet.&lt;/p&gt;[[You came back to the middle of the room.|Courtain room]]

You looked back at those two days (just two days? So many happened...). You went through so much. Humiliation, physical and psychological violence, even sexual harassment. Your bullies wanted you to be a victim. Your value was questioned.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I love you, sweetie,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; -- that word again -- &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;But you know how it works. If you lose a daughter, it&#39;s possible to get another. There&#39;s only one Led Zeppelin.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

This reference to &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; lost a little as he referred you as his daughter, but you would roll your eyes anyway. The dad jokes.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;But I&#39;ll pay,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. With his approach to giving you money that could mean only one thing. 

You pretended to be outraged. 

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Are you trying to get rid of me? Again? Seriously, dad, I live here!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He sighed.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ve noticed, sweetie. 18 long years...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You snorted.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Who&#39;s coming?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;Stan&#39;&#39; is coming over.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Uncle &#39;&#39;Stan&#39;&#39; was the closest friend of your father. He was your godfather and you liked him very much. You hadn&#39;t seen him two or three years, because he moved abroad. But he was in touch.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Uncle &#39;&#39;Stan&#39;&#39;? Mmm... I&#39;d enjoy seeing him.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t haggle, young lady! Well, speaking more seriously, &#39;&#39;Stan&#39;&#39; has some presents for you and he wants to see you. But, you know, you could give your old men some space. We want to get drunk and catch up on old times. We appreciate your existence, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, but your presence isn&#39;t needed.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ll consider that.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Despite that your father called you his daughter, the conversation went as usual. You always had a good relations with your father. In opposite to your mother, he more often  tried to solve problems than to yell at you because you had problems.

You went to your-not your room. You noticed that among new things there was something what looked familiar. You recognized the photo that hung on your wall. &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Look around the Oliver&#39;s place&quot;)&gt;&gt;You saw it earlier today, at &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39;.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;[[The photo of your friends.|Photos]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="265" name="Voice change" tags="" position="20869,347" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You were in the Warren. 

The nickname Bunny Lady was appropriate. Her classroom was full of rabbits and bunnies of all kinds. Most of them were stuffed toys, some really old. But there were also porcelain figures of rabbits at the playground, the poster of &quot;Cosmic Jam&quot; and even one real stuffed animal, which presumably had been part of the exhibition in biology class many years ago. 

You couldn&#39;t know that yet, but Bunny Lady was a preview of many of your academic teachers. She was lazy and she didn&#39;t care if she taught you anything. She assumed that if she was understanding to students they wouldn&#39;t report her as a horrible teacher. Well, it worked. Even people who wanted to write an exam in Social Studies didn&#39;t complain. Students in &#39;&#39;Rosset High School&#39;&#39; needed such a place like Warren, the safe heaven in stressful school life.

There was only one moment during the lesson when Bunny Lady pretended to be a demanding teacher. She chose, as she named it, a little bunny to answer some questions, especially about the news of the last week.

Bunny Lady was looking at the class for a while, smiling.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Many bunnies... It&#39;s hard to choose... Oh, I know! Today we have a special day for dear local authorities. We have someone who clearly knows everything about it. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;! Join me at the blackboard, my little bunny.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;The Playboy bunny,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; some guy joked. Of course, it was immortal joke in this classroom.

You come up to the front of the class. If someone didn&#39;t take a good look at your changes, it would be a great opportunity. You felt like you were at display. You caught some glances. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; looked at you with some sad satisfaction on her face. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; looked in the mirror demonstratively. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; were smiling wryly.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;A little smile, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;! Well, well, well... Where should we start? Ooo, I know, I know! Let&#39;s tell us when will we have local elections this year?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It would be 17th of September,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you answer with little sigh. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Until the end of May committees will collect the signatures to register themselves to the elections.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, I see you can just barely wait to collect signatures for your mom!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; Bunny Lady laughed. &lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;But will you collect signatures just for her?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Oh, tricky question.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;No, for the committee she will join,&quot;&lt;/span&gt;  you answer. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s because we have...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; -- you tried to remind the official term -- &lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;...proportional representation.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You spoke two last words in one octave higher. Students bulged their eyes out. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; laughed loudly, contagiously. All your class joined her.

Bunny Lady missed the joke, of course.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hey, she answered correctly! We have proportional representation. So, what you mom has to do to be re-elected, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

There was complete silence in the classroom. Everyone waited for your response. You felt really uncomfortable. 

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;My mother needs to find a committee to join and she will get a place on the list,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you answered in your new girly voice. People were grinning and chuckling. You blushed a little. &lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;After the election, all votes on the list are summed up and if the committee will win some mandates, people with the highest number of votes will be elected.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Good job, my little bunny! Sit down.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You came back to your table. People were grinning at you.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Such a sweet voice, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Well, your road to feminity was officially announced.&lt;/p&gt;[[A girl&#39;s first day.|Position in pack]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="266" name="The summary of the prologue and the chapter 1." tags="" position="10352,505" size="100,100">&lt;p&gt;&#39;&#39;The Parity&#39;&#39; is a game about choices.

&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your mother woke you up. You were barely conscious. Why didn&#39;t your alarm launch? You looked at your phone. No, it was just too early! It was 6.00 AM! Grumbling, you sank into your bed. But it wasn&#39;t enough for your mother.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, get up! You will be late!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Mooom... It&#39;s six-o-clock. I will be on time...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

But your mother was tenacious, as always. You sat in the bed. There you noticed again the changes. You touched your new &lt;&lt;print $envy0&gt;&gt;. It still felt unreal. You looked at yourself in the mirror. Well, nothing more happened. But during this day you&#39;d become a girl in all parts it counted. &lt;&lt;if $beAgirl==true&gt;&gt;Your cock tingled in waiting.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

You touched your penis. Well, it was the last time you woke up with morning wood. It was awkward sometimes, especially during the trips. You thought about &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. How he was managing the new equipment? He probably was sleeping now. Even as a girl he was getting up late. With short hair and no need to apply any make-up (even such light like he used to apply) he probably would be sleeping until 7:30. You envied him right now.

You looked at your phone. You were still &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; in social media. Of course, you could see your new &lt;&lt;print $envy0&gt;&gt; on the photos, but you were still male. It was strange, you thought. Apparently, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; wanted to keep the secret for now. 

You sighed. Of course, it was better than &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; changed you instead of &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; or &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. It turned out that you had a loyal best friend and you didn&#39;t become a whore of some sick bastard. But as many mysteries solved, a new one appeared. What was her plan for you? 

Maybe you should text somebody? You thought about &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Dick quarrel&quot;) and not visited(&quot;Back off from the accuse&quot;)&gt;&gt;You owed him an apology. He acted recklessly and you had a right to be mad at him, but in fact, he wasn&#39;t guilty. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;Then you thought about &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, what surprised you. Well, she knew. She was the only girl you knew better and you could talk with her. Maybe you would need her help.&lt;/p&gt;[[You texted him.|Text Olivier]]

It was pure absurd. You were stressed and scared, but he really wasn&#39;t a bad guy material.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You thought about those all suspicions you had about his part in the plot against you. You felt stupid. Of course, he couldn&#39;t be against you.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It was &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.
She started to change me. 
&lt;&lt;print $transformation[0]&gt;&gt;.
My parents call me &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You waited for a moment, but of course, he didn&#39;t respond. You were sure he was sleeping. 

You sighed again.&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if not visited(&quot;Text Dorothy&quot;)&gt;&gt;You thought about texting...
&lt;br&gt;[[$they.dorothyName|Text Dorothy]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;[[It was time for breakfast.|Your mother]]&lt;/p&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="285" name="Text Dorothy" tags="" position="18691,308" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. It was strange that you saved her number, after all...

You chuckled involuntarily because you thought that texting her was far more unbelievable than being changed into a girl. You start to type.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi.
&#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; hugged me.
My new name is &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.
My parents already call me that.
&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; changed me.
It&#39;s some kind of ritual. I change slowly.
You probably could see changes in the photos.
I don&#39;t know why I text you.
Yesterday you called &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.
I don&#39;t think you care.
Sorry.
Have a nice day.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You felt a wave of regret. Why did you text her? Why couldn&#39;t you undo those messages? Would she call you? Would you call her back? Would you tell her about your new &lt;&lt;print $transformation[0]&gt;&gt;?  What had gotten into you?

Then you shrugged. She didn&#39;t care. For sure. She never really cared. She wouldn&#39;t notice that her first boyfriend would change into a girl. Fuck her. Fuck you. You winced.&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if not visited(&quot;Text Olivier&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You thought about texting...[[$they.oliviaMaleName|Text Olivier]]&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;
[[It was time for breakfast.|Your mother]]&lt;/p&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="286" name="Your mother" tags="" position="18993,328" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your mother made you a breakfast! It shocked you. You had to prepare your morning meals yourself since elementary school, which meant that you usually skipped them and bought something on the way to school. Well, she usually left before you and her breakfasts... Well, you weren&#39;t interested in them much. Yogurt with fruits and some musli wasn&#39;t really something you consider as a meal. But as you were dazed after a bad night, you could barely swallow, so it was nice to eat something you didn&#39;t have to bite.

Your mother read something on her phone and took some notes. She was focused as always. She was a strong woman. She was a real fighter. She worked hard and never gave up. There were traits you could admire, but it was hard to live with her. You knew she loved you, but you rarely felt that. You knew your parent didn&#39;t plan you - they were two college kids who threw caution to the wind. She lost two years and it looked like she still, after 18 years, tried to make up for the lost time. She had her carrier and her duties. You and your father rarely were a priority. She had no time for your problems.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Remember to take your certificate of employment,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said when she finished reading. &lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;Mr. Zagorsky&#39;&#39;&#39;s waited two weeks for you.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I was sick,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said with your mouth full. You knew it was the only chance to speak up. Your mother had her schedule in such conversations, your responses weren&#39;t necessary. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I will go tomorrow.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&quot;Because today I&#39;ll grow my own cunt, thanks for asking, mom&quot; - you added in thoughts.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;He will take vacation next week. If you don&#39;t take it by Friday...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I said I would.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;...you&#39;ll get your tax refund in July. I thought you needed that money.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I do. And I will take this paperwork. Tomorrow.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;You better. The tax offices aren&#39;t work quick these days.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You nodded, irritated. You could predict that free breakfast was a trap.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;So, you got any big plans this weekend? Besides the concert, of course?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You looked at her carefully. Was your mother abducted by aliens and replaced by this creature? You thought that...&lt;/p&gt;[[...maybe your mother was nicer to her daughter than to her son.|Be open to your mother]] &lt;&lt;flashy $display&gt;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;ll probably show the city to &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; girlfriend. But I really don&#39;t know what she would want to see. She&#39;s a rich girl, you know. Her parents have a horse ranch and she usually spent her vacations abroad.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Does &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; want to impress her?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t think so. He rather... Well, how to put it... He wants her to understand him. To get to know his background. You know, they live in two different worlds...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;If not two different galactics. Are they planning to meet &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; mother?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You chuckled.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Of course not. His mother doesn&#39;t know they are coming. They will stay at &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; flat. His parents are out for some retreat or seminar.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Your mother seemed to be miles away.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Mom?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She smiled lightly.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m sorry, dear... So, it will be four of us?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Or five. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; might come too.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

The lack of enthusiasm in your voice had to be very clear. Your mother looked at you carefully for a moment.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Are you still angry with her?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You noticed the tension in her voice. You nodded. You saw the relief on her face. Well, she didn&#39;t like her as your girlfriend, so if this reality clearly didn&#39;t like her as your friend.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;She&#39;s troubled girl, you know.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I know, mom. You are still working with her father, who caused most of this trouble.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You couldn&#39;t resist. Your mother talking so much about the wrongness of this world, but even when she heard about the violence in &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; family, she still cooperated with her father, who beat her wife and daughters.

She irritated, as always.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Not always you can choose the people you have to work with, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said sternly. &lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s much worse if you still hang with them even when you don&#39;t have to.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

You snorted.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, mom. It always so easy to have the excuse that absolves you.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;What did that mean?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You know exactly what that meant, mom. Thanks for a breakfast.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You got up from the table.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s easy to judge,&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve noticed. You are doing it constantly.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You came back to your room. Well, maybe she was nicer in the beginning, but finally, the conversation ended up as always. Well, you had to go. You turned around. Well, you had only new clothes...&lt;/p&gt;[[You got your father&#39;s clothes.|Get your father&#39;s clothes]] &lt;&lt;sneaky $display&gt;&gt;

Surely, it wasn&#39;t just a small-talk. Your expercience thaught you that those conversations were in fact interrogation of some kind. 

So you shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know, mom,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;But &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; is coming, isn&#39;t he?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You nodded. You focused on your breakfast. You didn&#39;t know what was going on. Your mother liked &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; and was a great help for him, but...

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;He&#39;s comming with his girlfriend, right?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Ok, that was weird. But you shrugged again. Your poker face was something you were proud of. The years of training paid off.

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Do you know her?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

That was a safer question.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Not really. Her parents are rich. They have a horse ranch. What&#39;s going on, mom?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, nothing, darling. A horse ranch? That&#39;s really interesting.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You realized that she relaxed a little. That all was really strange. Her statement about high school couples was unequivocal: they had no future unless they end with teen pregnancy.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, I have to get going. Thanks for breakfast, mom.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;You are welcome. Anytime.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She actually smiled at you! You were puzzled.

Well, if you planned to go to school, you would wear something and your wardrobe changed a little...&lt;/p&gt;[[You got your father&#39;s clothes.|Get your father&#39;s clothes]] &lt;&lt;sneaky $display&gt;&gt;

Unfortunately, your mather took the clothes from the dryer. So, you had to go to your parents&#39; bedroom.

You waited for the moment your moment would pick up the phone. It didn&#39;t take long. You smirked. It was like in an action movie. Your mother closed the door to the kitchen. Clear.

You sneaked into the bedroom. Your father seemed to sleep deeply, but you knew it wasn&#39;t the truth. Your father was a light sleeper. If something happened, he always was on his feet before your mother. He told you once, that all people who had an unsafe childhood were light sleepers. You didn&#39;t make proper research, but in fact &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; were sleeping very lightly. 

So you had to be really quiet. &lt;&lt;if $approaches.contains(5) and $approaches.contains(6)&gt;&gt;Quiet and quick. You didn&#39;t have a chance to pick up the most fitting clothes, but as your father had the same height and was a slim man, it wasn&#39;t so hard not to look ridiculous. The action was quick. You took the t-shirt and shirt, boxers, socks, and jeans. Later, you took his sneakers. You had to wait for another conversation your mother had to leave. 

You smiled to yourself. One step forward to restore the control.
&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Dick quarrel&quot;) and not visited(&quot;Back off from the accuse&quot;)&gt;&gt;[[You went to school.|Welcome commitee Martha]]&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;[[You went to school.|Welcome commitee Olivier]]&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $fatherClothes=true&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;And you were, but not enough. You took just a few steps when your father opened his eyes and lifted his head. He sighed, but his sigh became a yawn.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello, sweetie,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. He looked at the watch and yawned again. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I know it&#39;s late. I&#39;ll get up.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;  

You smiled at him and retreated from the room. Meh. It was useless.

You got warm. The wave of the heat struck you. You felt like in the sauna, but you didn&#39;t sweat. You felt lighter and smaller. In fact, you were getting smaller.

You looked in the mirror. You saw you were shrinking. The process was slow but noticeable. With your 1,80m height, you were rather an average boy. You reached this height in two years. You started to grow rapidly at the age of 14. Before the mountain trip two years ago you bought some clothes you wore until now.

You lost at least 15 centimeters in 5 minutes. You had this height in middle school. It was that moment when you outgrew your mother. You were sure you were equal now.

Besides this reduced height, nothing happened. Your clothes fit you more, but you still had your boy figure, so they were too tight or too loose in some places. You still looked like a poor crossdresser who stole his sister&#39;s clothes. The difference was that your parents were home and they weren&#39;t able to catch you by doing something wrong because you didn&#39;t have other clothes.

Still, wearing those clothes made you felt ambivalent. You felt like some perv. But when your mother came to your room to hurry you up, her so usual behavior made you a little more comfortable.

You sighed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Dick quarrel&quot;) and not visited(&quot;Back off from the accuse&quot;)&gt;&gt;[[You went to school.|Welcome commitee Martha]]&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;[[You went to school.|Welcome commitee Olivier]]&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="292" name="About the dreams" tags="" position="19815,159" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; smiled coldly.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;I like to think that I&#39;ve saved her life,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Even you can&#39;t deny it.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; snorted.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, in other way you&#39;d lose your lab rat, wouldn&#39;t you, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he snapped back.  &lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You don&#39;t give a shit about her.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not her friend, of course. But I helped her. She is alive now, she has passed all exams. What&#39;s the matter, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;? I was a stranger to her but I helped her. It took hours... months! Sure, I don&#39;t like &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. I think she was a terrible person even before &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; started to haunt her...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Shut up! I don&#39;t care why you are doing this, as long as you don&#39;t pretend you are such a heroine. You are not, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. You are a selfish bitch who sometimes needs people, so you are manipulating them until you achieve your goals. You were helping &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; until you didn&#39;t find more interesting toy. This fucking making-whore-ritual! Even you can&#39;t deny it!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;I have my priorities. I promised her help, not the baby-sitting, remember. Luckilly&quot;&lt;/span&gt; -- her voice was full of contempt -- &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;she had her knight to save her from herself.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;You are in the home stretch, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said. &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Struggle&quot;)&gt;&gt;You pulled a face when you heard that name, but you had to admit that it was hard to get angry on someone who gave you coffee.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Do you really think so? I mean, &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Some reason&quot;) or visited(&quot;You won&quot;)&gt;&gt;of course, he didn&#39;t do much in this dream, but why wouldn&#39;t he try today?&lt;&lt;elseif visited(&quot;Beaten&quot;)&gt;&gt;he... I... Well, I don&#39;t think he will let it go... Let me go.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I avoided some trouble this night...&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, I&#39;m pretty sure,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said and chuckled. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;The terms of both rituals are fulfilled. I wished for change the first girl who would be hugged by nomination and he wished that you&#39;d be this girl. We are settled, relax.

She giggled. She was very proud of herself and self-confident. The day was sunny and warm. It was nice to think that all your fears would fade. But you remembered the poker room and all these temptations &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; gave you.

That was enough to learn and adjust without drooling &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; on your back.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; You allowed yourself at the little smile.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; noticed it. 

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;&lt;if $transformation.contains(&quot;face&quot;)&gt;&gt;Girl, you should smile more!

You blushed a little. The compliment from such a pretty girl like &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was something. She was smiling too, but her smile was more mischievous. 

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Tell me, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. You are changing for a while, from yesterday...

Or...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; -- she paused slyly -- &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe boys start to look promising?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You choked on coffee you were drinking, but it wasn&#39;t the only reason your face turned red.&lt;/p&gt;[[You were into girls.|Into girls]]

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I really want to believe you,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said sadly. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;But I can&#39;t. I just can&#39;t. I&#39;ve heard for two days that I&#39;m going to be a girl... and well, here I am! So if this is true, why won&#39;t the rest fulfill as well? Those two days were hard. I tried my best and I didn&#39;t always succeed. And you... just finished it? Sorry, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, I appreciate that as you couldn&#39;t save me from hugging you protected me from &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. But I know he wouldn&#39;t let it go, &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Some reason&quot;) or visited(&quot;You won&quot;)&gt;&gt;even if last night didn&#39;t finish well for him&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;he is possessed by the thought of me being his slut&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;. I can&#39;t just relax, sorry. I don&#39;t feel safer, really. But the coffee is good, thank you.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You were surprised how much bitterness was in your own words. You were really tired of this tension.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; put her delicate hand on your shoulder and smiled warmly.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;I know, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, I&#39;m really sorry that you had to got through this shit,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said quietly. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t blame you. I hope I will be close when you finally realize that you are free. I think you&#39;d be a very happy girl, really. It would be a pleasure to watch you. Well, I can&#39;t do much to cheer you up.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;I changed my mind. For now, at least.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You thought for a moment. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;You asked about... 
&lt;/p&gt;[[...the first dick you saw.|First dick]]

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;d be surprised how many times you&#39;d think about the next dicks you will see, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;But that all &quot;first dick&quot; rumors are bullshit. Of course, it could be that the first dick you saw would be the first dick you suck. It happens. Usually, when a boy shows you a cock he&#39;s ready and willing to use it. And you will find that you&#39;ll be quite horny after the change will be over. So, you know...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; -- she smiled widely -- &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;It can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. You saw &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; cock as your first, didn&#39;t you?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You nodded.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;I bet it&#39;s a piece of meat. Transformed boys are usually well equipped.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You blushed. Yeah, he was well equipped, indeed. 

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;ll have some wild thoughts. Some of them are from the source we call &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39;. But some of them would be your own. Girls are horny too. So, if you start to think of something really kinky, don&#39;t panic. Just think if you really want to do this. Maybe it would be worthed trying.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Actually, it cheered you up. In fact, that was what you thought about the Parity before you found out about the ritual that could direct the transformation. In this moment you were really grateful to &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. She knew a lot of &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; and even if you didn&#39;t know her sources, they seemed to be reliable.&lt;/p&gt;[[The new school day started.|3 chap school]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="300" name="Into girls" tags="" position="20323,356" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; smiled.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Obviously,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said slyly. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, I keep my fingers crossed that you will endure. &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; will try to persuade you to have sex with boys, but, well, it&#39;s up to you...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She hesitated, then smiled even wider.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;In fact, that would be really, really interesting, if you were lesbian.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You didn&#39;t have a chance to get used to the idea that your interest in having sex with girls would be considered as interesting.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know what is so interesting in my future sex life. You don&#39;t complain about lack of sex in your own life, I suppose.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She giggled.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe even I will tell you something... someday. You know, some tips for a beginner... Wow, you are blushing!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

Indeed, your face turned red. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was an extremely attractive girl, such discussions just embarrassed you, even if you knew that with every change you became less attractive for her.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;But you say that &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; would... persuade me to be into boys, right? Yeah, it fits her. The nineteenth century didn&#39;t leave much space for lesbians.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; looked at you condescendingly. If something ruined sometimes the perfectness of her beauty it was this snooty behavior. You remembered that she as &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was really annoying with his arrogance.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;You //really// think that &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; is &#39;&#39;Alice Rosset&#39;&#39;, don&#39;t you?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Her voice sounded like she asked a stupid child if he or she believed in Santa Claus.

You shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Who else?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;The proper question is: what else? But it isn&#39;t important, don&#39;t bother,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said lightly. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;The fact is that I took care that you could be still interested in girls. I did many kinky things to get you... mmmm... potential. So I&#39;m glad that you&#39;d try. But boys are hot too, you know.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $oliverCock==true&gt;&gt;You thought about &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; cock and you had to admit that you believed her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;You already saw the school building.

She obviously enjoyed every second.&lt;/p&gt;[[New school day.|3 chap school]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="301" name="Into boys" tags="" position="20319,472" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You blushed a little, when you admitted it. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; smiled warmly.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, I bet it&#39;s hard and confusing for you,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;At least when you still get a hard-on when you are thinking about boys. When you&#39;ll get wet it would be more and more natural to you. And after the first sex, your doubts will end, I assure you.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She chuckled. You weren&#39;t so sure. Of course, being a girl had clearly a sexual aspect and it was important, but you didn&#39;t want to think about it right now. Physical and social aspects of being hugged by &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39;, as you didn&#39;t mean to be &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; slut, concerned you more. &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $investigation.contains(&quot;Caroline&quot;) or visited(&quot;Caroline&#39;s sex dream&quot;)&gt;&gt;You witnessed how quickly &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; adapted to her new sexual role, but you were glad you wouldn&#39;t have to repeat her choices.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s hard to be gay or lesbian after a hug, you know,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; said. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;That whole thing &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; did is not about sexuality itself, but about the fertility. And as you will have a woman&#39;s brain... Well, boys will be hot. That&#39;s it.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

The fertility was a neutral replacement for &quot;you could get pregnant&quot;. It was definitely a case you wouldn&#39;t think of right now. But as you saw some male students going to school, you admitted that some of them looked good.&lt;/p&gt;[[You came to school.|3 chap school]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="302" name="Free will" tags="" position="20316,616" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; sighed.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Ok, I think we&#39;ve just started a philosophical discussion... before the first coffee!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she exclaimed and theatrically took a slip from her cup. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Do you believe in fate?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You rolled your eyes.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, I think I should drink too,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said and took a slip too. She giggled. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Not really. I think we make our own destiny.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She nodded.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Good. So you have free will. Of course, there is a way to break anybody. There are some powerful forces hard to be faced, but in fact, you can break any... I don&#39;t really feel that word fits, but whatever... You can break any spell. If you knew how to do it, you could resist a Parity too. Or undo it.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $beAgirl==false&gt;&gt;That last sentences lifted your hopes up.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You didn&#39;t consider this. In fact, you didn&#39;t assume it could be possible.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

You remained silent.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; smiled, but it was a sad smile.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;The most important thing in this all is not to lose yourself and have some people who love you. You are loved, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. I&#39;ve learned a little about you. I heard about your family, especially your dad. I&#39;ve seen &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; when she took care of the people, and she cares about you a lot. You needed my help with a direct attack, but I&#39;m sure that you&#39;ll be fine.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You smiled. You thought about your father, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. Even you thought about &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. Yes, you weren&#39;t alone.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;But &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;... I mean, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;... And &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She shrugged. There was something very cold in her eyes and voice when she said:

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;As you said before. They are making their own destiny. And they are making it poorly.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;[[You came to school.|3 chap school]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="303" name="3 chap school" tags="" position="20570,329" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $feminineClothes gte 2&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $dressOk=true&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $dressOk=false&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You had two weeks of break from school and today was only the third day in the row you went there, but you had enough of it already.

To your surprise, it was quite normal. Maybe it was because of a presence of &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, who was really friendly to you.

The rumors that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; after one day she was hugged already was a slut spread widely, and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;... 

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; looked strange.

He didn&#39;t sleep well last night, that for sure. His face was pale, hands shivered a little. He muttered to himself. Every once in a while he was stopping rapidly with pure terror on his face. Whatever he saw, you were glad you weren&#39;t able to see it.

&lt;&lt;if $fatherClothes==false&gt;&gt;Of course, you felt eyes on you. You were shorter, your girly clothes drew attention. One of the girls praised your outfit, you weren&#39;t sure if she made fun of you&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $transformation.contains(&quot;hands&quot;)&gt;&gt;For sure, your feminine hands were too subtle to be noticed, but shoes were too big for your small feet.

You could see the relief on the faces of all boys. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;. 

The first lesson was about Social Studies. You had to wait eight minutes for your teacher who was called Bunny Lady. She was a short and fat woman in her late 40s. She dyed her hair red and she was one of the most extraordinary teachers you met. She didn&#39;t treat herself or her job seriously. You never saw her upset or angry. But she had her habits.

Bunny Lady was strict about that girls should enter the classroom before boys. She theatrically opened the door and said:

&lt;span class=&quot;femtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Ladies, after you!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You...&lt;/p&gt;[[...went with girls.|Go with girls]]

You heard that many times before. You remembered one of the scariest moments in your life when you were going across the bridge with her. You didn&#39;t really like the bridges. The river in your city was wide. The bridge was nearly one kilometer long. There was no barrier between a footpath and street, and cars moved quickly. It wasn&#39;t a comfortable walk, you rarely chose that route. 

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was walking annoyingly slowly. She stopped in the middle of the bridge and suddenly leaned out the barrier. If she lifted herself a little more, she would fall. You screamed and grabbed her. She laughed lightly and stroked your hair.

&lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;At least one person would miss me,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said and kissed you deeply. This evening you found the first white hair in your head.

At the end of your relationship, she was talking about killing herself constantly. That made you sick. There were moments you were sure she wanted to draw your attention and your assurances of love, and you swore yourself you wouldn&#39;t react anymore. But then the next crisis came and you didn&#39;t dare to risk.

Apparently, the therapy and medicines she took changed her a little. She found another victim of her depression. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was even better than you. He was convinced that every problem could be solved and the world was a pity place because people didn&#39;t try hard enough. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was smarter than him. 

It was of course the possibility that &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; made &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; more miserable. You heard rumors that most students that transferred from &#39;&#39;Rosset&#39;s&#39;&#39; committed suicide. It was a way for &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; to avoid her prey from escape. But you really didn&#39;t want to guess if &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; problems or behavior should be connected with supernatural. &lt;/p&gt;[[The school day began.|3 chap school]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="305" name="It was immoral" tags="" position="20318,163" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could only agree that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was a terrible person. You were still angry at her how she despised you. She could be cruel and calculated. She was saying about killing herself constantly. So you didn&#39;t blame &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; she didn&#39;t become her friend. They had too much in common, in fact. 

But you were sure that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was right. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was used. You heard that rumors that most students that transferred from &#39;&#39;Rosset&#39;s&#39;&#39; committed suicide. It was a way for &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; to avoid her prey from escape. You knew &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; enough to assume that such a target of the research was really tempting for her. She had to be really excited when she met &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. You doubted if she really wanted to help her, even if that was possible.

You didn&#39;t like that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; showed herself again in your life. She hurt you really hard. You didn&#39;t hate her but you realized you were happier when she didn&#39;t give a sign of life. Apparently, she just found the replacement - &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. 

You pulled a face. Here you were again! You were again in the world of hidden meanings, manipulations, and using human kindness against people who wanted to help. That was the &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; world.

But the changes only slower, but didn&#39;t end. Your face tingled again. Your nose looked smaller, the chin bones were a little higher. Your mouth darkened a little.

Then your face shifted. Your eyes seemed to be smaller, your eyelashes thicked and grew. Your skin was soft and flexible, however, you saw some reddish spots on them.

Your arms got a little thinner too, so these delicate, slender hands you had now didn&#39;t look so out of place.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Apparently, she didn&#39;t mind. She smiled at you friendly.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;The Parity calms down,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said lightly. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;No more gender swaps until the next time! Some other changes are still possible...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You sighed. That whole situation reminded you of the first weeks of the fresh year. The same marathon of gazing, commenting, and dominating.

The school day just started, so you had to choose some tactics.&lt;/p&gt;[[You kept your head low.|Step back]] &lt;&lt;sneaky $display&gt;&gt;

Your changes weren&#39;t complete, and you didn&#39;t want to make another show. You kept the distance and weren&#39;t active on the lessons. It was a good strategy, as the one of changes took place at the beginning of the lunch break.

You leaned against the wall. The warmth was concentrating &lt;&lt;if $transformation[0]==&quot;breasts&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $transformation.push(&quot;face&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;in your face.

God, I don&#39;t want to die! I don&#39;t want to be a fag! Forgive me, forgive me...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He didn&#39;t look at you and he didn&#39;t want your forgiveness. Even standing in front of you he didn&#39;t say that he was sorry because of his plans. You had no compassion for him right now. He choked the sperm again and actually started to pray. You turned around, shocked and disgusted. It was the fate you avoided thanks to &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. You imagined how &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; would laugh at you if you were in his position. Son of the bitch.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;What little tits she gave you,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he hissed. &lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;But don&#39;t worry. Your parents are rich, they&#39;ll pay for breast enlargement.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

That would confirm what &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; said about the calming down of the Parity. He couldn&#39;t change you. Physically, at least.

He approached you. He smiled. You noticed his lips were wet. When he came closer, you realized that they were soaked with sperm.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Come on, take your medicine like a good girl,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, come on!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you exclaimed. &lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You lost already. Don&#39;t you see? &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; changed me, this whole fucking thing is over. I won&#39;t be your slut, forget about it.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He grinned.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t give up before the end of the game. Maybe you are right... I am pretty sure you are right, in fact. But I&#39;ll try anyway. Maybe the two of us would surprise...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $approaches.contains(4) and $approaches.contains(5)&gt;&gt;He wanted to grab you, but you were quicker. He pulled a face. Definitely, he was slower than usual and clumsy. You avoided his other attempts. &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;He grabbed you. You screamed. You covered your mouth with a free hand, but he twisted it. You tried to hit him, to punch you, but he was just too strong. His wet lips met your mouth. You felt the taste of this sperm on your lips. You felt the taste of something else&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Poker table&quot;)&gt;&gt;. It reminded you of a poker table.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; If orgy had a taste, it would be this. The taste of sperm and sweat, and perfumes, and excitement... and fear, and violence. You wanted to throw up.&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $wetKiss=true&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Last time with female clients, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you heard a familiar voice. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You got some experience with men, maybe you should more train with them.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; let you go&lt;&lt;if $wetKiss==true&gt;&gt;. You wiped your lips and spat.

You realized that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was slower than usual. He had evidently a problem with focus. He tried to grab you, but he couldn&#39;t catch you. As earlier, he was stopping rapidly for a moment. There was a moment he caught his own tongue.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;I won&#39;t swallow...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he hissed. &lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;I have sluts to swallow... I&#39;m not a slut...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You knew it was a race against time. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; wasn&#39;t really a strong-willed person.

He smiled for a moment, that was a pure bliss on his face. Then he bulged his eyes out.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;No... No... No...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Then he started to choke. He desperately tried to spit, tried to breathe. His face turned red, then even blue. He threw up. You were sure he would suffocate. But then he spat. The little object fell off his throat. You looked at it. It was a poker chip.&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $chokedChip = true&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if not visited(&quot;Poker table&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; You couldn&#39;t describe the colors of this chip. When you thought about them later, you always used the term &quot;Lovecraftian&quot;. It turned out that it was fitting them well. Firstly, those strange tokens glittered in the unnamed, strange colors that could be described in the stories of Solitary of Providence. Secondly, love as a craft seemed to be a stake of the &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;s&#39;&#39; game.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;It was identical to chips you saw during the dream.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

You looked at &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, but he wasn&#39;t really a threat now. You saw tears in his eyes.

But there was a real try ahead you.

It turned out that only a few students in the whole school were interested in joining the project organized by the Institute of the National Remembrance. Your class teacher shouted at you all that it was unacceptable that the school with such results had so lazy students. Her warnings were blackmail. She said that she would cancel a June trip if at least a few people didn&#39;t join.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; looked really excited.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Finally this school joined to some interesting project,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;I did a little research about the Institute&#39;s activity in the neighborhood. It&#39;s an amazing job! The developers started to set fire to the abandoned buildings! Some of them were literally the torture chambers! There were inscriptions in the basements! Incredible!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;  

It was strange to see that beautiful girl talking about such things. She was clearly fascinated. She was raised in the district and she discovered something new about it. Something that broke the boredom of the poor neighborhood. You thought that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; wanted to be special. A part of her uniqueness could be the district she lived in. You knew that she waited to announce to the world that someone found the skeletons under her garden (she lived on the first floor).

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, would you join me to this project? You are interested in history. With help of your mom, we could enter the places nobody would penetrate!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You looked at her, surprised. You were good at history, but she never proposed to work with you.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;And what exactly would we do?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You didn&#39;t really listen to the lecture. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; changing into a boy was far more interesting.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;ll go to some kind of course about the identification and exhumation, they&#39;ll take us to some places and we&#39;ll describe one of those places that aren&#39;t marked. Please agree, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if not visited(&quot;Step back&quot;) and not visited(&quot;Just chat&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your answer interrupted the next change. &lt;&lt;if $transformation[0]==&quot;breasts&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $transformation.push(&quot;face&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;The warmth was concentrating in your face. You switched on your camera in selfie mode. You felt how your face was changing. To your surprise, you didn&#39;t look more feminine. You looked younger. Your facial features softened, your eyes and mouth seemed to be bigger, just like ears. In a few moments, you recognized yourself from the class photos of the late elementary school. You were shocked. Was she making you a kid again?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But the changes only slower, but didn&#39;t end. Your face tingled again. Your nose looked smaller, the chin bones were a little higher. Your mouth darkened a little. Your eyebrows looked less prominent, your jaw rounded. There were subtle changes, but when they occurred you looked like a twelve-year-old girl. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Then your face shifted. Your eyes seemed to be smaller, your eyelashes thicked and grew. Your skin was soft and flexible, however, you saw some reddish spots on them. It had to be your allergy to lactose. Your face became more mature, now you looked like a 14-15-year-old. This was a pretty girl face, but it just developing a more womanly appearance. You saw that process for a while until it stopped. If you had a good looking sister she could look like that.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $transformation.push(&quot;breasts&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;The warmth was concentrating in your suddenly swollen chest. Your breasts were growing slowly. It looked like an accelerated process of normal development of breasts. Firstly the left breast grew a little and it was slightly larger than the right until they reached a size between A and B cups. Then they rounded and still grew, however, they remained perky. The unfamiliar weight reminded you of a time when you broke yourollarbone. You gained some weight then and the first in your life got some fat. Your new breasts were more solid in weight. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So you had breasts. &lt;&lt;if $braOn.length gt 0&gt;&gt;You were glad you wore a bra. It definitely helped.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Now you thought that not wearing a bra was a mistake. Your breasts bounced with your every move.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;[[You decided to join the project.|Join]] &lt;&lt;flashy $display&gt;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Great!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she exclaimed. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m so tired with working with people who think that I will do all the work alone! Thanks, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;  

You smiled too. As &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; didn&#39;t like the history, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; seemed to be a reasonable choice for someone who wouldn&#39;t let you down in the middle of the project. You knew this neighborhood. As a kid, you and your scout team played in the &quot;Book of fears&quot;. It was an old scouts&#39; game. The group of kids had to spend a night in a spooky place that was supposedly haunted. After that, the participants wrote down in the Book of fears information that there was nothing scary there. There were funny nights in old, abandoned places. You usually entered them illegally, two or three times you had to run because ruins were inhabited. You didn&#39;t meet a poltergeist, but some places were really spooky. You wondered if really were there some macabre stories behind them. 

Spending more time with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; could be useful also, if you wanted to know more about the Parity and &#39;&#39;Auntie.&#39;&#39;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;if not visited(&quot;Lunch&quot;)&gt;&gt;You went with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; to...

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; looked disappointed. 

You decided not to join her. You were sure that if you wanted to participate in this project you would have plenty of occasions to do that later. You didn&#39;t trust &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, you were pretty sure that she&#39;d use the opportunity to spy on you. You didn&#39;t want to be her lab rat. You imagined her coming to your home, talking to your parents, and asking, how did you find the room she prepared for you. It was a very uncomfortable thought.

Of course, the project was interesting. You raised here in the last moment when your district had its &quot;old&quot; character. You didn&#39;t miss the dangers and years of neglect, but you were probably one of the last persons who visited some places and talking to some old people. Your district had a soul... or maybe an aura. It was a living, breathing structure that was being destroyed every day and with every investment. You wanted to know where those skeletons were, which spooky tenement house had a spooky story hiding in the shadows and dust. You wanted to see the inscriptions reminding citizens about people who used to live here. You wanted your district important. You were tired of hearing that the local river was a line between Europe and Asia. People in your city... Nay! People in your country were equally important. Some of them were just poorer than others.

You sighed. You definitely didn&#39;t want &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; to know your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;&lt;if not visited(&quot;Lunch&quot;)&gt;&gt;[[The lunch break started.|Lunch]] &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;[[The rest of the school day.|Figure transformation]]&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="317" name="Olivier on white horse" tags="" position="21643,16" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; turned around rapidly. He clenched his fists. Even in his condition he reminded you a boar or a bear walking on two legs.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was calm but watchful. He approached slowly and kept a distance of several meters.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;What the fuck did you say?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; hissed through clenched teeth.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You heard me,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; answered quietly.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t provoke me, you bitch. You grew a dick, but you are still the same scum you were!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Your best friend smiled.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, I&#39;m the same I was. What about you, pal? What kind of scum will you become?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;Shut up! Don&#39;t say a word!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I was there, bro. I was using the girls&#39; restroom, but the walls were thin. I heard enough to imagine the rest...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He dodged, because &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; charged him. Jock yelled. There was so much despair in this cry that you jumped. He stopped after a while. He was looking around, but his gaze was empty.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not a fag! I did it... I&#39;ve done this...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, I wasn&#39;t a lesbian then too. I like this pub because boys don&#39;t hit on every girl they see.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

It looked like &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; had some kind of seizure. He shivered and even started to drool. He looked terrible. He buried his face in his hands.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m still there... I&#39;m still there... I can&#39;t get out...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He was repeating it for a while. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; came closer to you. He stood to you. Then &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; calmed down. When he looked at you and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, he was himself again.

&lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;You fucking bitches,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said without anger. &lt;span class=&quot;roberttext&quot;&gt;&quot;You think you&#39;ll make me a fag, don&#39;t you? No fucking way. I&#39;ll get you. You fucked up with your transformation, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. If you wanted to steal her from me, you should be stronger. I&#39;ll crush you if you stand between me and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Actually, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; laughed.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, big boy, take her, rape her! I can&#39;t stop you. I am weaker! She has a nice juicy cock between her legs now, so she&#39;d never been prettier for you. You can suck it. The last chance, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. Tomorrow you would find her far less attractive.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; looked at you with pure disgust. If his eyes could get through your clothes he would see your cock right now. He spat and turned around. He left.

You looked at &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You should improve your Prince Charming lines, dude,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said. &lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Encouraging the badass to rape a lady in distress sounds really bad.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I had to improvise.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;What a relief! I was thinking you actually prepared this line.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He smiled, but he was still touched. He sighed.

But you knew that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; school was ever more strict than &#39;&#39;Rosset&#39;s&#39;&#39;, and you knew that he wasn&#39;t really a type of rebel. So, something had to happen.

You picked up the phone.

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;Good morning, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you heard his calm and deep voice. You could imagine him right now - hidden in locker room or restroom with serious face but with sparkles in the eyes. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; eyes were the only reflection of his soul he didn&#39;t learn to control. &lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;Can you talk right now?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure. Something happened?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;Not really,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he admitted. &lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;I shouldn&#39;t call, probably.  But I can&#39;t focus. I keep thinking about you... Oh, that sounded... Anyway, I was dreaming about you. Shit, that didn&#39;t sound good also... But in this dream you were a little girl, so... Crap!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You couldn&#39;t help yourself but giggle. It was a really girly giggle, but that was really funny. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was generally a good speaker. You saw him several times in action. But he was helplessly shy when he spoke to girls. It was strange that he actually got a girlfriend. Well, he was a cute and nice guy, maybe that&#39;s why...

You realized that you described &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; as cute.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Dude, breathe!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, right!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he calmed down. &lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;Do you remember our first holidays? We were 6 then. I was dreaming about this trip. You were upset because... Wait, someone&#39;s coming.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

So this dream wasn&#39;t an ordinary dream. It somehow affected the people in it. &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Tell everything&quot;) or visited(&quot;Skip the details&quot;)&gt;&gt;You thought that it was strange that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; didn&#39;t remember the first dream. Maybe that was some impostor? &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Stop her&quot;)&gt;&gt;That man in grey suit somehow reminded her.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s just &lt;&lt;textbox &quot;$they.claudiaName&quot; &quot;Claudia&quot;&gt;&gt;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. So his girlfriend found him. &lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;Welcome, my lady.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;claudiatext&quot;&gt;&quot;I was wondering where did you disappear,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you heard a muffled girl&#39;s voice. You heard a reproach in her voice. &lt;span class=&quot;claudiatext&quot;&gt;&quot;What are you doing?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m speaking with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said and you could hear some tension in his voice.

&lt;span class=&quot;claudiatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Call her later. You know you can&#39;t use your phone here!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You didn&#39;t know her yet but she already started losing the points. But then you felt a familiar wave of warmth and this tingling feeling. You were changing!

You decided to...&lt;/p&gt;[[...continue the conversation.|Chat longer]] &lt;&lt;flashy $display&gt;&gt;

You can affect them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You bit your lip, then took a deep breath.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;So... What about this dream?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;Well...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; -- &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; cleared his throat -- &lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;We used to play that we were pirates then. &#39;&#39;Stan&#39;&#39; was our captain and made those funny &quot;arrghh&quot; and we were his crew.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You remembered that. You learned a lot of shanties then, especially those with swearwords in lyrics. Your mother wasn&#39;t impressed. 

You had to deal your attention between &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; and transformation. You quickly put the headphones on the phone to hear him and switched on selfie mode in your camera.

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;...but those kids didn&#39;t want to play with us because you were a girl and they saw you playing with dolls. Are you there, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;claudiatext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.claudiaName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; hissed. &lt;span class=&quot;claudiatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Stop it!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;  

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure I am!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you assured him. What a bitch.

&lt;&lt;if $transformation[0]==&quot;breasts&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $transformation.push(&quot;face&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt; But you focused on face. You switched on your camera in selfie mode. You felt how your face was changing. To your surprise, you didn&#39;t look more feminine. You looked younger. Your facial features softened, your eyes and mouth seemed to be bigger, just like ears. In a few moments, you recognized yourself from the class photos of the late elementary school. You were shocked. Was she making you a kid again?

But the changes only slower, but didn&#39;t end. Your face tingled again. Your nose looked smaller, the chin bones were a little higher. Your mouth darkened a little. Your eyebrows looked less prominent, your jaw rounded. There were subtle changes, but when they occurred you looked like a twelve-year-old girl. 

Then your face shifted. Your eyes seemed to be smaller, your eyelashes thicked and grew. Your skin was soft and flexible, however, you saw some reddish spots on them. It had to be your allergy to lactose. Your face became more mature, now you looked like a 14-15-year-old. This was a pretty girl face, but it just developing a more womanly appearance. You saw that process for a while until it stopped. If you had a good looking sister she could look like that.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $transformation.push(&quot;breasts&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;But you focused on your chest. Your breasts were growing slowly. It looked like an accelerated process of normal development of breasts. Firstly the left breast grew a little and it was slightly larger than the right until they reached a size between A and B cups. Then they rounded and still grew, however, they remained perky. The unfamiliar weight reminded you of a time when you broke your collarbone. You gained some weight then and the first in your life got some fat. Your new breasts were more solid in weight. 

So you had breasts. &lt;&lt;if $braOn.length gt 0&gt;&gt;You were glad you wore a bra. It definitely helped.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Now you thought that not wearing a bra was a mistake. Your breasts bounced with your every move.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;So you decided to hide your dolls to persuade them to play with you,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; continued, completely unaware of what was just happened. You felt like you were masturbating during this call. &lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;You told me you dug them in the beach, so, of course, I went to dig them up. Dolls are expensive... And... well... I didn&#39;t have many toys then... And you liked those dolls before you discovered vampires... But it turned out that you didn&#39;t dig them. You just told me, because you knew I was a terrible liar. You just wanted to trick those boys.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He chuckled. You realized that he had really nice laughter. You wanted him to laugh more.

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, that&#39;s nothing but I felt I should tell you that. I mean... You were six then! But it was so like you!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class=&quot;claudiatext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, you are ruining your scholarship!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

It was really so like you? You considered yourself as a smart person and you could be creative. And yes, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was no help in giving guffs. But he had other advantages. He shared a sweet story about someone else when he took the role of a naive child.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, for reminding me that!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said with enthusiasm. It was a little exaggerated, but you wanted to reward him the &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.claudiaName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; excuses. &lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You should always be careful when I tell you something, dude!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He chuckled.

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;I try, but you are good at this... So, we will see on Friday, right?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I barely can wait.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, me too. I miss you... all,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he added it quickly. Well, you missed him too.

After the call, you sighed. You looked at yourself. Every change you occurred made you a girl &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; already knew and remembered. That was crazy.&lt;/p&gt;[[Lunch break.|Lunch]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="320" name="Cut it" tags="" position="21598,800" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $backto = &quot;Cut it&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $player.allowChangeApproach==1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $player.changeApproach = &quot;Quick&quot;&gt;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure thing,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said calmly and a little sad. &lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sorry to bother.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;No, you don&#39;t bother, I&#39;m just... I have to go, bye!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You leaned against the wall.

You decided to call him back...[[...after lunch.|Lunch]]&lt;/p&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="321" name="Lunch" tags="" position="22017,578" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no normal canteen in &#39;&#39;Rosset High School&#39;&#39;. There was a buffet where you could buy toasts or casseroles, but you couldn&#39;t really name it lunch. A school had liberal rules, so adult (or almost adult) students were allowed to go out for lunch or order it to the school building. It was common that during the long break students sat on the benches at the schoolyard and ate pizza or Chinese food. 

There were plenty of restaurants and pubs nearby. &#39;&#39;Rosset High School&#39;&#39; was next to the main street of the district. When four years ago your mother said about the plans that this street could be closed at weekends to make the promenade you and your father laughed at this idea as surrealist. Most of the tenement houses were devastated and dirty, restaurants were cheap places for local drinkers. When the subway station was opened here, there were alarming articles in the press that local criminals would use the subway to expand the area for their actions. 

Nothing like that happened. The lower prices caused that students started to rent flats here. The young people needed a place to eat and drink. Thank to the subway people could go to the city center in 10 minutes. Many offices moved here, encouraged by the accounts and friendly politics of the district&#39;s authorities. It was a slow process, but now the main street was a mix of old poverty and new vintage and hipster places.

In the middle of your transformation, you felt unsure if you should stay or go. For school students, you were some sensation, for people in the street you were just ordinary schoolgirl. But you didn&#39;t get used to your new voice and appearance.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; invited you to go with her to a new Thai restaurant.

Like most of the buildings in the neighborhood, it was built in the nineteenth century. It was closed in the early 1990s and abandoned to deteriorate for 20 years. Now, renovated, it was a space for lofts and offices.

The restaurant looked fancy. The theme was pandas. If Bunny Lady reorganized the Warren as a restaurant, it would look like a tasteless version of this place. There were photos and frescos. Stuffed pandas sat on the reserved seats. They were very sweet.

In the center, there was a little fountain. It was backlit, which made the water looked like it was in an aureola. &lt;&lt;if $auntie.Defiance lt 0&gt;&gt;You came there and touched the water. You heard &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; giggling.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s just a water... Should I be worried?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Not really. I used to touch every fountain for six or seven months...

It reminded you of the time you spent on the scout team. 

You weren&#39;t hungry until you smelled the meal. That yogurt on the breakfast as the only food you ate today seemed to be ridiculous. You ate quickly. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; didn&#39;t drink coffee, but he drank tea instead. The jasmine tea he ordered was delicious.

Well, the warmth focused after a while. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; noticed it too. He turned around to some fresh year girl.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hey, borrow me a mirror for a moment!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

This constant attention was tiring. You need a moment of break.

The street was crowded. People at any age were hurrying to their businesses. They weren&#39;t aware that some curse was changing your gender, changing your life. You were looking at the passer-by. They looked so... normal. It was just an ordinary, warm day. One young mother was buying a cake for her little child. The girl at age two or three was crying. There were some people at the bus stop. An old man was reading a newspaper, a girl older a few years than you was speaking in Russian or Ukrainian. Another old man walked with his dog. Normal people. Normal life.

Normal people and you.

You looked at yourself in the shopfront. You looked almost like a schoolgirl. If you met someone like you on the street you certainly would mistake him for a woman. But as you were looking at your reflection, you realized that you were just the same element of the picture as people around you. That was a surreal feeling. This mix of natural and supernatural.

You grew boobs. You were hungry. Your voice got higer. You talked to your parents. Your feet shrunk. You needed to piss. Your life didn&#39;t stop for the moment of your transformation. It didn&#39;t even slow! Second after second, minute after minute. Breath after breath. Your life didn&#39;t end. It only changed.

It reminded you that the Death card in Tarot meant a change. It was a good thought. &lt;&lt;if not visited(&quot;Robert lurking in shadow&quot;)&gt;&gt;Unfortunately, you didn&#39;t have a chance to contemplate that peaceful moment. You saw someone in the reflection. It was...

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, you&#39;ve saved me from &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. I am grateful. I really am.

You got up the table. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; face darkened. You saw the sparkles in her eyes.

She sounded really sorry. She didn&#39;t look at you in the eye. Here she was, the bombshell, the girl on her way to becoming a celebrity, a girl with some occult power, embarrassed and sad. She looked like a little girl that moment.&lt;/p&gt;[[You forgave her.|Be friendly]]

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Ok, nevermind. Just take that photo!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You shrugged. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;You didn&#39;t have an account on Instagram and generally it was a foreign world to you. But you knew &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; raised a fine money there.

She took a hairbrush and a pocket mirror. She looked at herself carefully. Apparently, she noticed some imperfections you couldn&#39;t see. You didn&#39;t follow her preparations. The familiar warmth and tingling sensation efficiently drew your attention.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It would be nice if you warned me, you know,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said. 

She shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Nah, you saw that coming,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she snapped back slyly. She gave you her pocket mirror. 

&lt;&lt;if $transformation[0]==&quot;face&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $transformation.push(&quot;hair&quot;)&gt;&gt;You felt a tingle in your hair. It began to grow and lightened a little.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; giggled again. She took the green hairband and tied your hair in a simple ponytail.

You were shocked. Was she making you a kid again?

But the changes only slower, but didn&#39;t end. Your face tingled again. Your nose looked smaller, the chin bones were a little higher. Your lips darkened a little. Your eyebrows looked less prominent, your jaw rounded. There were subtle changes, but when they occurred you looked like a twelve-year-old girl. 

Then your face shifted. Your eyes seemed to be smaller, your eyelashes thicked and grew. Your skin was soft and flexible, however, you saw some reddish spots on them. It had to be your allergy to lactose. Your face became more mature, now you looked like a 14-15-year-old. This was a pretty girl face, but it just developing a more womanly appearance.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;You are beautiful girl, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You weren&#39;t as pretty as her, but surely it was an attractive face.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

She set the camera on her phone and took many photos. You made some &lt;&lt;if $beAgirl==true&gt;&gt; girly faces&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;faces&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;. After a minute or two you got a little bored. Your mouth itched because of your smiles. Finally, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; chose one photo and added some filters. She added some hashtags and sent the photo.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Thank you, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. Many people want to take a photo with me, so it was nice to ask you. It was nice to stop thinking about myself as a product.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

There was some sadness in her voice. You looked at her, surprised. At this moment she looked confused and a little lost. You thought about this difference between between her and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You seem to know a lot about this,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said carefully. 

She smiled wryly.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Enough to save you, girl, for sure,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;I suppouse you are aware in how deep shit you could be right now.

She snorted.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;I didn&#39;t say a word. I didn&#39;t even know that such a ritual exists.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;But &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;... I mean, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;...&#39;&#39;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;I gave her directions how to perform a ritual I once performed. But I didn&#39;t told &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; anything.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;So who...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You couldn&#39;t say a word. You were literally speechless. You tried to speak, but you were muted. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; looked at you with irritation.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter, understood? Stop sniffing around, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.

She tried to act normally.

You smiled.

Those milk-bars weren&#39;t really pleasant places. You knew that in this place there was filmed a scene in the cult comedy of the late 1980s. You would say that only a few things have changed since them. But it was cheap, so it was a place where new inhabitants mixed with old townspeople. You looked at them with pleasure, because they were living proof that the insanity of the Parity couldn&#39;t haunt you everywhere. You could have a normal life somewhere.

Those pancakes were really good.

Then you walked back to school. You didn&#39;t hurry. You were enjoying this moment of peace... Until the next change hit you. You stopped in front of some shop. There was a mirror on the display, so you could follow the changes.

Then this strange itching began, concentrating on your face. You touched it. You felt how it was changing. To your surprise, you didn&#39;t look more feminine. You looked younger. Your facial features softened, your eyes and mouth seemed to be bigger, just like ears. In a few moments, you recognized yourself from the class photos of the late elementary school. You were shocked. Was she making you a kid again?

But the changes only slower, but didn&#39;t end. Your face tingled again. Your nose looked smaller, the chin bones were a little higher. Your lips darkened a little. Your eyebrows looked less prominent, your jaw rounded. There were subtle changes, but when they occurred you looked like a twelve-year-old girl. 

Then your face shifted. Your eyes seemed to be smaller, your eyelashes thicked and grew. Your skin was soft and flexible, however, you saw some reddish spots on them. It had to be your allergy to lactose. Your face became more mature, now you looked like a 14-15-year-old. This was a pretty girl face, but it just developing a more womanly appearance. You saw that process for a while until it stopped.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;You are beautiful girl, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You weren&#39;t as pretty as her, but surely it was an attractive face.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

She was quiet for a moment.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Let&#39;s say that &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; as we call her isn&#39;t exactly a person. It&#39;s better to think about her like a river or a sea. She has her... current. And that current forces people to do such things. It&#39;s dangerous and powerful, but you really can&#39;t say she&#39;s evil or immoral. &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; is like a rough sea or steep mountain. You can drown, you can fell, but it isn&#39;t her intention.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She was whispering. You saw a fascination and respect in her face.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;And like a sea or river, &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; is... well... let&#39;s say inhabited. There are some... beings in there. And well, they are not exactly evil, like a shark that attacks you isn&#39;t evil, but they are dangerous too. But they have some habits... And eating habits... And nature...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She went pale. She was shivering a little.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Usually, the victims of the Parity - which we could name the part of &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;s&#39;&#39; current, are forced just to make what she wants them to do. Generally, &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; is some kind of life force, so it pushes you to create more life. But there are methods of navigating the current. There are methods of... well, let&#39;s say, fishing. And some people know how to do that. I call them divers. Apparently, one of them spoke to &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. That&#39;s it.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She asked for a check and paid.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You don&#39;t tell me everything,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said. &lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You know who spoke to him.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She winced.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ve already told you too much. If you take my advice seriously, you&#39;ll find a nice boy and you&#39;ll fuck with him. It&#39;s probably the best protection from any further problems.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You chuckled.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Wow. If you put a marriage between finding a boy and fucking, it would a really good Catholic preach, you know.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She shrugged. She was really serious.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, let&#39;s say that I appreciate every religion that allows exorcisms. Eh, let&#39;s go. I&#39;m not in the mood of taking photos.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;[[You came back to school.|Figure transformation]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="331" name="Clear the air" tags="" position="22280,1144" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $relations.Olivia=$relations.Olivia+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You were embarassed. You accused &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. You were unjust. You treated him awfully. You looked at him sadly. You tried to find suitable words. He smiled slyly, stopping the eating for a moment.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Are you going to tell me something, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

There were mischievous sparkles in his eyes.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes. Look, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, I... I am sorry about yesterday. I was scared but... You didn&#39;t deserve to hear something like that. Not from me, at least. You are my friend... I lost my mind then. Sorry.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He made a comically serious face and knocked three times in obvious parody of Catholic confession.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Go and don&#39;t sin again. Amen.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He chuckled.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I have to apologize you too. For two things, in fact. I was angry too. I had a really hard time with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. He&#39;s even more stubborn than you. So I overreacted...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, no problem!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you answered quickly. He smiled wryly.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;And I&#39;m sorry that I said I didn&#39;t want to screw you. Damn, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. Was it hurt when you fell off from the Haven?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He laughed loudly. You rolled your eyes.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You deserved that! Now, seriously. How you doing?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
[[Your life was nightmare.|It&#39;s awful - transformation]]

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s awful,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said. You looked at yourself. &lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s fucking nightmare.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He squeezed your hand and look at you with concern.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; couldn&#39;t change you anymore, so...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You interrupted.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s not about &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;! Well, not only about him! Look at me! They robbed me of my life! I don&#39;t want to be a girl! I&#39;m not a girl! I don&#39;t know how to be a girl! &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; killed me, you understand?! I&#39;m my own fucking impostor... Oh, no...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; -- you wiped the tears that showed in your eyes -- &lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Look at me! I&#39;m so weak. I&#39;m crying because of nothing... I&#39;m pathetic...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You were sobbing. He wrapped his arms around your shoulders.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You are not crying because you are a girl, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. You are crying because you are scared and confused. I get it. I really am.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You... You are getting this so well... And you didn&#39;t want to be a boy...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah. I&#39;m trying very hard, but it&#39;s weird. You know, it happens here. In this school. You can do this. You would sit to pee, but it doesn&#39;t mean that you couldn&#39;t be yourself. Really.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m so scared. I&#39;m so angry. I&#39;m... I can&#39;t even name all of these emotions. I feel like I&#39;m going to explode.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m here for you. I won&#39;t leave you. I don&#39;t know how, but we&#39;ll find a way to change you back. &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; changes people in two ways, doesn&#39;t she?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You somehow calmed down. You hugged him hard and kissed him on the cheek.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Thank you... Thank you for being here.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

The crisis passed, at least you didn&#39;t cry again.&lt;/p&gt;[[The rest of the school day.|Figure transformation]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="333" name="You will live - transformation" tags="" position="22567,1163" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You shrugged and tried to smile convincigly.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I do my best,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said. &lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You somehow managed, so I will try too.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He smiled.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;ll be fine,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he assured you. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;ll be fine. It&#39;s part of this school...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure. It&#39;s part of high school unique experience.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

He chuckled.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Poor &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;! He hurried up a little with getting a girlfriend. Such a pretty girl to adore!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You froze, then you blushed furiously. He laughed.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Relax, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;! I mean, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;! I&#39;m joking. Maybe a little, but I&#39;m joking. Wow.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; He looked at you and laughed again. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Before you get used to it I&#39;ll have a great time!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You sighed and rolled your eyes. He chuckled again.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Do it again!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;What?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Roll your eyes! You&#39;re so cute and sweet...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You rolled your eyes again and sighed:

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Men!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

He laughed so hard you were sure he would fall off the bench.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Fuck me! The &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;ocentrism&#39;&#39; finally explained. There was a little, spoiled princess inside and she finally showed up! Poor &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;! Poor me! We have no chances with her!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;A spoiled? Me? Dude, my father gave you two VIP tickets for free! I had to work three months to repay him!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Poor &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, she had to work like we, the workclass...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, shut up! Fuck you!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He smiled wryly.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;But you didn&#39;t deny you were a princess!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You punched him.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;For you, the empress of unicorns!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Ooo, be careful when you talk about unicorns!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Finally, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; acted like he should.&lt;/p&gt;[[The rest of school day.|Figure transformation]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="334" name="Actually is nice - transformation" tags="" position="22565,1281" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You smiled slyly and started to play with your hair. You even batted your eyes.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Actually... I have a good time. I can barely wait for the end!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Happier as a girl&quot;)&gt;&gt;He chuckled.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I knew my place in pussy team would be filled with someone worthy.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;He looked surprised, but smiled wryly.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I bet you&#39;ll make a very girly girl. Squeaking, pink and clothes.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You blew him a kiss.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I haven&#39;t decided yet what kind of girl I want to be.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

That was a little awkward. You sat together at the bench. People who knew each other for their whole lives, yet you looked completely different. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was still adjusting to be so tall, he definitely didn&#39;t know what to do with his legs. Surely, you had many manners that looked oddly in your changed body.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You kicked asses, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. Look at &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; now. One becomes a slut, the second one would be a blast for male prostitutes and here you are! You&#39;ve already found a guy who bought you a dinner!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You chuckled.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I hope it isn&#39;t a date. You could better than that.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He laughed.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Easy, girl. If I want you to feel special, you&#39;ll have no doubts.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, you know how to draw my attention.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure I do. Girls are easy.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You rolled your eyes and sighed.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Men!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You both laughed. It was nice to have a friend during such crazy day like this.&lt;/p&gt;[[The day went on.|Figure transformation]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="335" name="Figure transformation" tags="" position="22776,413" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest of the school day passed through quietly. It was strange how the oddity of your transformation mixed with a usual school routine. Teachers didn&#39;t go easy on you. Two weeks&#39; absence left some gaps in the class register, so you had to fill it with your homework and activity. Your voice quickly stopped to be the sensation. In fact, you looked mostly like a girl now, so it wasn&#39;t so odd that you had a higher voice.

The last thing that remained unchanged except your genitals &lt;&lt;if not visited(&quot;Get girl clothes&quot;)&gt;&gt;were your height and body shape&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;body shape&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;. The day spent in too tight clothes was really annoying, so you were grateful when the next wave of warmth started to concentrate on your waist, hips, and shoulders.

Your hips widened, your shoulders shrunk a little. You didn&#39;t really get an ideal hourglass figure, but you gained a really feminine shape. 

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You didn&#39;t really hurry, did you?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said to &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. She smiled slyly.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;I wanted to see the relief on this pretty face,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she answered. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;At least you&#39;ve got one extremaly feminine experience - you spent a day in uncomfortable clothes!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;  

When the last bell rang, you went home. You knew what that meant. The last changes. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; stopped kidding around. Even &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; didn&#39;t say a word. You were grateful to them both. They had changed their genitals rapidly, so maybe they understood what you were going through.

You left a school building as a nearly complete girl.&lt;/p&gt;[[You went home.|Time to go home]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="336" name="Time to go home" tags="" position="22976,447" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You went home. You knew what would happen when you went there. The last shreds of your manhood would disappear. You started to think about your life as a boy. The first thought was that at least you weren&#39;t a virgin. &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if not visited(&quot;Height transformation&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then you felt this tingling sensation again. You froze and held your breath. Something was going to change.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The wave of the heat struck your whole. You felt like in the sauna, but you didn&#39;t sweat. You felt lighter and smaller. In fact, you were getting smaller.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You realize you were shrinking. The process was slow but noticeable. With your 1,80m height, you were rather an average boy. You reached this height in three years. You started to grow rapidly at the age of 14. Before the mountain trip two years ago you bought some clothes you wore until now.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You lost at least 15 centimeters in 5 minutes. You had this height in middle school. It was that moment when you outgrew your mother. You were sure you were equal now.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So, well. Your genitals were the last thing to go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Remain there&quot;) and not visited(&quot;Justin&#39;s call&quot;)&gt;&gt;You decided you&#39;d listen some music, so you picked your phone. You noticed 3 missing calls from &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. You knew that he couldn&#39;t use his phone during the school day, so something had to happen! &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;

You came home. You rememebered &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; wanted you to text her when you&#39;d be ready to launch the final transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Remain there&quot;) and not visited(&quot;Justin&#39;s call&quot;)&gt;&gt;[[You called him back.|Call Justin back]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;[[You texted her.|Text Martha]]

You didn&#39;t really like the show she made about your vagina. It was a private thing. If you had to complete the transformation, at least this final moment you&#39;d experience alone, without audience&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Height transformation&quot;)&gt;&gt; or your mother hurrying you to school.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt; You were not at the display.

So, you did what you usually did after school. You unloaded the dishwasher and did your homework. You turned on some music. Of course, you couldn&#39;t really focus on anything, but you tried to live your ordinary life. You scrolled Facebook ignoring the notifications from Messenger for a while. Then you realized that it wasn&#39;t &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; texted you back.

Well, that was probably the friendliest message you received from her since... well, a long time. You hesitated for a moment. That was your last moment of being a male&lt;&lt;if $beAgirl==false&gt;&gt;, at least for a moment.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; Did you really want to spend it on the conversation with person who hurt you so bad as &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;?

You felt the growing excitement. You were going to see a naked girl, and even you were going to be that girl, your body reacted with a huge erection. You took off your &lt;&lt;print $shirtOn&gt;&gt; and threw it to the bed, but you threw too hard, so it fell.

You wore them off too.

You were touching yourself, delicately, shyly. Your ears, your lips, your cheeks, your smooth neck. It took you a whole two minutes until you let your shivering fingers reached lower, to your sensitive and soft breasts. Then, after the moment of caressing your stomach, you put your hands on your hips. You stood in that pose for a moment, admiring how feminine you looked.&lt;/p&gt;[[It happened!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="340" name="Stay in clothes" tags="" position="23473,50" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You fought the urge to be completely naked while your the last change. You wanted to save some dignity. You already were in girly room&lt;&lt;if $fatherClothes==false&gt;&gt;, you already wore girly clothes,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; that was enough.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; didn&#39;t hurry. That irritated you. Those all surprising changes were annoying. They reminded you that you had no control at all. She used every possibility to prove her power over you.

Screw her. You tried to do what you usually did after school. You unloaded the dishwasher and did your homework. You turned on some music. Of course, you couldn&#39;t really focus on anything, but you tried to live your ordinary life. Of course, you couldn&#39;t focus. You touched your penis through your clothes to make sure that it was still there. 

It was.

After 15 minutes you received the message from &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, but you didn&#39;t read it. You realized that the last change already started.&lt;/p&gt;[[It happened!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="341" name="It happened!" tags="" position="23632,471" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the opposite to the earlier changes, this final one started subtle. The increasing warmth seemed to radiate from the lower part of your stomach. There came the pulsating, tingling feeling. You felt how something inside you was moving, rearranging. You put a hand on your stomach. It was unbelievable. 

But pleasant, in fact.

Your penis was rock hard. In its last moments, it bulged proudly. Your testicles went gone earlier. You felt them moving inside your body. They switched somehow, becoming your new ovaries. This part of the process left you an empty scrotum, but it turned out that your male genitals wouldn&#39;t waste. You felt that your vagina was forming from the inside of your body. It was a weird, unclenching feeling. Finally, your body opened with a new hole under your cock. Your scrotum divided and shrank, giving you new labia.

Everything changed, only your penis reminded you about your original gender. It was still erect when started to shrink. That was probably the strangest feeling you had. It was an intensive, orgasmic experience. As a scrotum, your penis didn&#39;t disappear completely. It became your clitoris, remaining its sensitivity.

Well, it happened. From head to toe, you were a girl. You were another victim of the Parity, a new transformed girl in the history of &#39;&#39;Rosset high school&#39;&#39;. You experienced that change slower than most students had to equalize the number of girls and boys. And you were aware of what was happening in the opposite of confused freshmen.

To the world you were &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. A tight slit between your legs confirmed it. You breathed deeply.&lt;/p&gt;[[You tried your new equipment.|Try your new equipment]]

Complete girl.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if not visited(&quot;Undress&quot;)&gt;&gt;You took off your &lt;&lt;print $shirtOn&gt;&gt; and threw it to the bed, but you threw too hard, so it fell. It didn&#39;t bother you. &lt;&lt;if $dressOn gt 0&gt;&gt;Your undershirt had a little more luck because you were too stunning to throw.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Your dress had a little more luck because you were too stunning to throw.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; You stood in front of the mirror, admiring the sight.

You saw yourself. The pretty face, the perky breasts, smooth and flat belly and thin waist. In this moment you forgot that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; made you less attractive than her. You were above the average. &lt;&lt;if $braOn.length gt 0&gt;&gt;Your &lt;&lt;print $braOn&gt;&gt; confirmed your indisputable feminity.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Your breasts looked even bigger when they were exposed.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; You took off your shoes &lt;&lt;if $dressOn.length gt 0&gt;&gt;.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;and &lt;&lt;print $lowerbody.On&gt;&gt;.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; Only an erected penis tucked into your &lt;&lt;print $pantiesOn&gt;&gt; spoiled the ilusion.

You were touching yourself, delicately, shyly. Your ears, your lips, your cheeks, your smooth neck. It took you a whole two minutes until you let your shivering fingers reached lower, to your sensitive and soft breasts. Then, after the moment of caressing your stomach, you put your hands on your hips.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You looked at your groin. The bush of public hair contrasted with a smoothness of the rest of your body.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

You didn&#39;t hurry. You knew you had all afternoon and evening to explore your new body. You laid on your back. You started to touch your nipples. They were weird. Really sensitive and bigger than they used to be. It was a nice touch. You didn&#39;t have a place where the growing pleasure could concentrate, but at this moment you didn&#39;t really miss your penis. There was some warmth and tingling lower. You reached your clitoris, while you still massaged your breast with your other hand. It was sensitive and... intensive. You started to touch delicately. You breathed deeply and bit your lip.

You touched lower, deeper. Your clit was already moist and warm. It was really sensitive too. You insert your finger there, but you did it too quickly. You felt nearly nothing, except this odd feeling that you put something inside your body. So you backed off and started to rub.

You moaned and shivered. Wow, that was intensive. You rubbed harder. You involuntary crossed one of your legs. Your fingers soon were soaked with juices, but you didn&#39;t stop, you rubbed yourself more furiously. You felt increasing heat. You were moaning. You had to close your eyes.

Many foreign sensations went through your mind. You remembered mild &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; eyes. You were looking at &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; wry smile. You remembered boys at the showers after PE. Then you stopped to recognize anything. Your world flashed with ecstasy, there was nothing more in it. Everything was filled with the tingling pleasure radiating from your vagina. Then your orgasm blasted. You didn&#39;t moan. It was a shout. 

Panting and sweating, you were just lying, smiling. Your heart raced.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Definitely... I can get used to this...&quot; &lt;/span&gt;you purred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The end of chapter 3&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/div&gt;[[The summary of chapter 3.|Chapter 3 summary]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="343" name="Don&#39;t try your new equipment" tags="" position="23782,569" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;displaytext&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;anger $auntie&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You knew that &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;You wanted to know more&quot;)&gt;&gt;or whatever she lived in her &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;wanted you to be sexual activity.  Masturbation would be one step forward on the road that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; already was following.

So you resisted the obvious temptation. Being a girl was much more than rubbing a new clit. You didn&#39;t think you&#39;d miss many things if you didn&#39;t start your &lt;&lt;if $beAgirl==false&gt;&gt;temporary&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; life as a woman from masturbation. When you thought that you actually felt relaxed. That everything was new, and you wouldn&#39;t rush.

You smiled to yourself in the mirror. Well, you were a cute girl. You weren&#39;t someone&#39;s whore, you weren&#39;t cock-craving slut. There were a lot of strong women and girls in your life, so you never thought that women were weaker or worse than men. They were different, for sure, but you were more than sure that most of your life would remain the same. 

And if you decided to change something... You actually a little blushed.

Well, IF you decided to change something, it would be maybe a little more interesting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The end of chapter 3&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/div&gt;[[The summary of chapter 3.|Chapter 3 summary]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="344" name="Chapter 3 summary" tags="" position="23975,442" size="100,100">&lt;p&gt;&#39;&#39;The Parity&#39;&#39; is the game about choices.

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. Thanks for calling me back.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You recognized immediately this mild, deep voice. 

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Something happened?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;No, not really. I&#39;m sorry that I disturbed you during school... You probably thought that I wouldn&#39;t go to a concert or something. No, everything is fine, we&#39;ll be on Friday.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You could text me, dude.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;Probably I should... But... Well... It would be a little awkward. Because... well... I called you because I was dreaming about you that night... And... You know how that sounds!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You heard how confused and embarrassed he was. You smiled a little. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; wasn&#39;t really good at talking with girls and it was funny to listen to him in that situation.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I bet you can&#39;t beat &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. Was I good in this dream?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

There was a silence for a moment.

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;Well... You are always good, I think... But it was rather a flashback and we were 6, so... Ummm... But yeah, of course. You were the best six-year-old girl I&#39;ve ever met.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You chuckled. You were sure he was blushing right now. But you realized that situation was serious.

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;Well...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; -- &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; cleared his throat -- &lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;It was a dream about our first vacations together. We used to play that we were pirates then. &#39;&#39;Stan&#39;&#39; was our captain and made those funny &quot;arrghh&quot; and we were his crew.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You remembered that. You learned a lot of shanties then, especially those with swearwords in lyrics. Your mother wasn&#39;t impressed. 

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;...but those kids didn&#39;t want to play with us because you were a girl and they saw you playing with dolls. Are you there, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I am,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said quietly. So those dreams could affect dreams of other people. Even people out of &#39;&#39;Rosset High School&#39;&#39;.

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;So you decided to hide your dolls to persuade them to play with you. You told me you dug them in the beach, so, of course, I went to dig them up. Dolls are expensive... And... well... I didn&#39;t have many toys then... And you liked those dolls before you discovered vampires... But it turned out that you didn&#39;t dig them. You just told me, because you knew I was a terrible liar. You just wanted to trick those boys.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He chuckled. You realized that he had really nice laughter. You wanted him to laugh more.

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, that&#39;s nothing but I felt I should tell you that. I mean... You were six then! But it was so like you!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

It was really so like you? You considered yourself as a smart person and you could be creative. And yes, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was no help in giving guffs. But he had other advantages. He shared a sweet story about someone else when he took the role of a naive child.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, for reminding me that I can be any pirate girl I want,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said wryly. 

He chuckled.

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;I can barely wait to see you again,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Me too.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;I miss you... all,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he added it quickly. Well, you missed him too. Really. You knew he needed to be separated from his mother, but still, it was strange to hanging around without him.

After the call, you sighed. You looked at yourself. Every change you occurred made you a girl &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; already knew and remembered. That was crazy.

Well, after a short time you&#39;d be nothing more than a girl he knew and remembered. You would be any pirate girl you wanted. You thought about &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;[[You texted her.|Text Martha]]

You were ready for a solitary walk when you saw &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; waving at you. She had two coffees from Starbucks and approached quickly. She kissed you on the cheek.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Wow, look at you!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she gently touched your &lt;&lt;print $transformation[0]&gt;&gt;. &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $transformation.contains(&quot;height&quot;)&gt;&gt;You noticed that you were the same height now.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;This is amazing! I know I should get used to this already, but still, when I look at those transformations, I am really excited! Oh, it&#39;s for you!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

She gave you a coffee, smiling friendly. You hesitated for a moment.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;ll need more than a cup of coffee to earn my trust, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said and took a slip. &lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;But this is a good start.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She giggled. She was clearly excited.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, I bet! I hope you eventually forgive me. I had no bad intentions. But we&#39;ll talk later. First the work!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

You felt the tingling and the warmth again. Before you could react, you started to feel the changes. &lt;&lt;if $transformation.contains(&quot;legs&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $transformation.push(&quot;hair&quot;)&gt;&gt;You felt a tingle in your hair. It began to grow and lightened a little. You never had long hair, so you didn&#39;t really know if they were straight, but when they reached the height of your ears, they waved a little. Your face seemed to look smaller with the longer hair. Your hair grew slowly until it was shoulder-length. It tingled your neck. It felt like some insects sat on you. 

You swept your hair. It was thick and heavy. The fairer strands reflected in the light. They were soft and nice to touch.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; giggled again. She took the green hairband and tied your hair in a simple ponytail.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;You have to choose your own style, girl.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $transformation.push(&quot;legs&quot;)&gt;&gt;Your legs felt oddly. You touched them. You realized that the hair on them vanished. They were smooth. Everything around you seemed to become a little bigger, so you had to lose some of your height. Your hips widened. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; had to hold for a moment because the decreasing size of your feet caused that you lost your balance. Your feet were now slender and delicate. You lost several shoe sizes for sure.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

She looked pleased about the changes. She flashed you with her smile.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Now we can have our first girl to girl talk!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;[[You started the conversation.|About Robert]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="350" name="Welcome commitee Olivier" tags="" position="19667,253" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $dressOn.length gt 0 or $skirtOn.length gt 0&gt;&gt;It was really strange to wear &lt;&lt;print $lowerbodyOn&gt;&gt; outside.

It was nearly a mysthic experience to walk those familiar streets in a feminine clothes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;This time &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was waiting for you. It kept surprising you.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourmaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Do you have a watch on your dick that you are punctual now?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you asked wryly. He rolled his eyes but smiled.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;As I see your &lt;&lt;print $transformation[0]&gt;&gt;, I suppose tomorrow you&#39;ll prove me that girls can be on time. I can barely wait!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he snapped back. He leaned over and kissed you on the cheek. Apparently, the hand-shake you shared yesterday was a single exception. &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;if $transformation.contains(&quot;height&quot;)&gt;&gt;He chuckled and stroke your hair. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;What a cute midget you became.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There was some mild tone in his voice.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;

Then you noticed &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. She had two coffees from Starbucks and approached quickly. 

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Wow, look at you!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she kissed you on the cheek and gently touched your &lt;&lt;print $transformation[0]&gt;&gt;. &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $transformation.contains(&quot;height&quot;)&gt;&gt;You noticed that you were the same height now.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; looked at her with disgust.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Why am I not surprised to see you here, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he asked. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Always in the middle of action when someone&#39;s life&#39;s breaking apart.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He spat. She smiled at him wryly.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;You are forgetting the role I usually take in such situations,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she snapped back. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Anyway... Your life is not breaking apart, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. Maybe you&#39;d break the bed if you jerk off too hard. You&#39;ll live, big boy.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, this is how people you &quot;helped&quot; manage. Until you get bored of them, of course.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;For now, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; is very interesting.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

After she said that, you felt the warmth and the tingling feeling again.

&lt;&lt;if $transformation.contains(&quot;legs&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $transformation.push(&quot;hair&quot;)&gt;&gt;You felt a tingle in your hair. It began to grow and lightened a little.

Then &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; sighed.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;I suppose all our way to school I will have to hear accusations and insults. Well, the price of altruism, I believe.

This time you found yourself in some long corridor. It had to be the place connected somehow with the poker room, at least the floor and wallpapers seemed to fit. There were some doors in this corridor but you knew you shouldn&#39;t try to open them. You felt that you didn&#39;t want to go //there// and you certainly didn&#39;t wish to invite anybody //here//. So you sit on the floor that was surprisingly soft and warm.

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Good evening, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you heard the voice. You looked up and saw the man in the suit. &lt;&lt;if not visited(&quot;Caroline&#39;s sex dream&quot;)&gt;&gt;There was a tall man in his late twenties or early thirties, handsome and dressed in an expensive, well-fitting suit. His look was cruel, his smile insolent. He was lighting a cigarette and clearly enjoying his time.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;It was the same man you met before, the same who had sex with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Who are you? Where are we? And how do you know my name?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Such clever questions! My name&#39;s &lt;&lt;textbox &quot;$they.davidName&quot; &quot;David&quot;&gt;&gt;. I run this place. And I know your name, my sweet &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, because you are the student of &#39;&#39;Rosset high school&#39;&#39;. I&#39;m interested in all boys and girls from that school. Especially in those who weren&#39;t boys or girls before. But we are in the waiting room. Let&#39;s say that those, who run places can pick up the guests from here. You don&#39;t want to meet them here, believe me, so I propose we will go.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You listened to the sounds that came from the closed doors and realized that indeed you didn&#39;t want to meet the creatures that made that noises.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Where are we going?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; has plans about you. So, I suppose, you have to go behind this curtain. It&#39;s not usually here.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You realized that next to you was a red curtain that certainly wasn&#39;t here a few moments ago. 

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Or... I can show you my game. Some of your friends already know it and love it. It&#39;s a risky gambling and it had certainly an erotic character... But... If you want to know better what the Parity is... I advice you to join me.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;[[You joined him.|Caroline&#39;s breasts]]
&lt;&lt;if not visited(&quot;Courtain-glow&quot;)&gt;&gt;[[You went behind the curtain.|Little Justin dream]]&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;[[You went behind the curtain.|Old bathroom]]&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="352" name="Little Justin dream" tags="" position="24842,670" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You opened a curtain and you found yourself on the beach. It was a Summer evening, you saw a few people around, gathering around the ice cream parlor. 

The surroundings looked familiar. You looked around. This breakwater looked the same as this one which saved your uncle &#39;&#39;Stan&#39;s&#39;&#39; life during the vacation... how many... 12 years ago?

You noticed a little boy digging ashore. There was a lot of sand in his hair. He was really engaged in this digging. He clearly was looking for something.

You saw a little girl who was observing a boy from distance. She had to be his age. She wore a green one-piece swimsuit and a straw hat with a green ribbon. 

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;&lt;textbox &quot;$they.justinName&quot; &quot;Justin&quot;&gt;&gt;, stop it!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she exclaimed. Her thin voice was really loud. &lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You won&#39;t find them!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; She nearly sang.

A little boy stopped and looked at her. His chubby face was comically serious. He squinted his eyes.

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;I will!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he shouted back and he started to dig again, furiously.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You woooon&#39;t!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

The girl came closer to the boy. He shouted:

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;I wiiiiiiiiill!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Children, can you keep your voice down a little?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; the voice behind you said. You jumped. The man who said that and who was now coming to the toddlers was your father! The younger version of his, though. Your parents were 21 when you were born. This man couldn&#39;t be older than 27, maybe 28. 

A boy froze and blushed furiously. He stood up, staring at the ground.

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sorry, sorry, sorry...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he mumbled.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Wow, boy, relax! Easy!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; your father exclaimed. He squatted next to the boy and stroked his hair, smiling warmly. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I didn&#39;t tell that something is wrong. I asked you to be a little quieter. That&#39;s all. What are you doing here?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

The boy took a peek at a girl, who sighed loudly and rolled her eyes theatrically. 

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; dug in her dolls here,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. 

Your father bulged his eyes out.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Why did you do that?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he asked the girl who stomped her little foot. Her face went red.

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;Because the boys said that pirates don&#39;t play with dolls,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; the boy explained. &lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;But this is stupid. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; is a pirate girl. I am a pirate boy and I play with cars. She can play with all toys she wants.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Little &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; looked like she was going to cry. Her father opened his arms. She hesitated for a moment, but she hugged him. She started to sob.&lt;/p&gt;[[Dream went on.|Little Justin dream 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="353" name="Caroline&#39;s breasts" tags="" position="24659,193" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You were again in the poker room, just like in the second dream. There were two people sitting at the table. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; and the man who met in the corridor, however you were sure that he was following you.

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello, gorgerous, join us,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said and showed you a free chair. He was checking you out openly. He clearly enjoyed what he saw. &lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;I have to say &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; did her job nicely. I appreciate that look more than this vulgar bimbo &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; created. You&#39;ve become a beautiful young woman, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. I bet you won&#39;t order new improvements, like our sweet &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; smiled slyly.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Can you really bet?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she asked. She looked at the stack of chips next to the man. He laughed.

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;I never bet against the transformed girls&#39; vanity,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. &lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Or their creativity. But, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, you have to excuse us. You interrupted a &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; show. She worked very hard to get those chips she wants to spend right now. I suppouse she would become more manly, as her goal is to change back...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He chuckled. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; actually blushed. She took some chips from her own little stock and said:

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Bigger tits.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Then she shivered and moaned. You saw how chips were absorbing into her body. She squeaked, then put her hands on her modest cleavage. After the transformation, her breasts were little, something between AA and A. They quite fitted to her fragile body, but it was true that she could be marked on porn sites in category &quot;thirteen&quot;. Now her breasts were growing, which was clearly a pleasant, sexual experience for her. You were grateful that your own transformation wasn&#39;t such orgasmic because moaning like her in front of the class would be an embarrassing experience. You looked at her, fascinated. Two mounds of flesh were growing slowly. She was squeezing them, biting her lips. When the changes were completed, she took a deep breath. She had a full A-cups, maybe even more. You were surprised how satisfied you felt that she had still much smaller breasts than you.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Ooo, fuck...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; sighed.

The man in the suit chuckled. He looked at you.

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;In the moment, my sweet sister. For now, we have to introduce our pretty guest. Why are you still standing, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;? Sit, my lady, sit.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

As his voice sounded like Johnny Depp&#39;s Sweeney Todd encouraging Alan Rickman&#39;s Judge Turpin in Tim Burton&#39;s musical, you hesitated for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;[[You joined them.|Join them at the table]]
[[You stayed away.|Stay away from the table]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="354" name="Join them at the table" tags="" position="24835,101" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;defiance $auntie&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $gameSet= true&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You sat at the table between the man and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. He smiled at you.

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Those chips can do much more than satisfying your expectations of appearance,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. &lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;For most of transformed students, the Parity is just a force that &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; has. But for us, the divers is a game. One of the many games you could play at the edge of the Universe. Most of my... friends despise &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39;. They have other tables and the games...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He looked at the mirror you saw &#39;&#39;Bimbo-&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. You looked in this direction and blinked. You saw the countless amount of similar rooms in the reflection. It was possible to make such a reflection by facing two mirrors. But you realized that those rooms were real. You saw many different people in them. It was some kind of screen or even a passage. The rooms were countless. As you looked at them, you started to feel dizzy. You couldn&#39;t take your eyes off of the mirror. It was summoning you. You weren&#39;t even sure if it was really on the wall. You were sure that when you stand up, you&#39;d fall and be absorbed into the world of reflections. But it wasn&#39;t the worst. As you watched, you noticed that there was a space between those rooms. It was empty and full at the same time. And you felt the pure terror when you thought that you could fell into that void. You shivered as you felt the presence of powerful minds that &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; couldn&#39;t compare. It was a terrifying awareness of your own nothingness. You stare and someone... something... was staring back.

Then you were again in the poker room. You didn&#39;t notice when the man in the suit stood up and covered the mirror. He was smiling at you, but this time you noticed some compassion on his face.

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s rude to stare at neighbors, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. &lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;They could feel invited to pay you a visit.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

You shivered again and turned your backs on the mirror.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You risk so much... To get bigger tits?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He laughed.

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s probably the best comment I&#39;ve ever heard. No, of course not. We don&#39;t risk much, in fact. Because you see, the game is set.

You noticed that there was a card in front of you. You knew somehow it was yours.&lt;/p&gt;[[You took it.|Look at your cards]]&lt;&lt;quick $display&gt;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to scary you, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. &lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Nobody will force you to do anything against your will.

You looked around. There was something wrong in this room. He was the same and not the same. You tried to remind the differences but it was impossible. It was like one of the dreams about childhood - some things looked different, but still, you recognized them. You weren&#39;t sure if that bookcase was in this room before. Maybe it was just covered by the curtain. But now it drew your attention because of the squeaks. 

Yes, squeaks. The books seemed to squeak. You came closer. However you couldn&#39;t recognize the single words, you were sure that it was some kind of language. The books were moving a little like they were shivering.

Next to the bookcase, there was a curtain and the familiar glow. As you were watching, the light seemed to be fading.&lt;/p&gt;[[You took one of the books.|Women]]

You didn&#39;t need a signature &quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;/&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;&quot; to recognize them. They hold each other&#39;s hand and looked calm. But there was a third person behind them, emerging from a mirror. You recognized her too. It was &#39;&#39;Bimbo-&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; you met last night. You looked at her with pure disgust.

You put the card away. The man in the suit and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; looked at you with sly smiles on the faces.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;You can collect more cards, you know,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said. &lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;At least, you control your own card. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; isn&#39;t so lucky anymore.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She showed you one card in her hand. There was a naked and terrified &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; in the middle of the picture. He was kneeling. Around him, there were some naked men.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Play or be played, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she hissed. 

You realized that you underestimated &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. You were sure the threat she caused as a boy was a matter of past. It seemed that she got some new abilities to harm people. You knew you were high on her list.

The man in the suit chuckled.

&lt;&lt;if $chips gt 0&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;As you were a naughty girl, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, you could even bet on the next game. But I think that it would be fair to explain you rules before we let you play.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; snorted.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;You weren&#39;t so generous for me, master.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Because you are just my whore. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; is a middle class girl, one of the pillars of our society. Never forget your place, my sweet sister.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She winced and looked at you with a pure hate in her delicate face. You saw her determination.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Unfortunately, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; has no chips to place on the next game. But we will explain her rules, won&#39;t we, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Pawns don&#39;t need to know the rules,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said looking at you with hunger. 

The man smiled again.

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;I love that spirit. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, you have to be careful. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; is a bitch with the plan.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Both of them...&lt;/p&gt;[[...leaned over the table.|Watch the game]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="357" name="Take a look at tokens" tags="" position="24967,195" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $backto = &quot;Take a look at tokens&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $player.allowChangeApproach==1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $player.changeApproach = &quot;Clever&quot;&gt;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, sure,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said. &lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;ve just proposed me patricipation in the game with the posibility of the reality-shifting. How stupid do you think I am?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;I would call you careful, not stupid... But it is what it is. The offer is honest. You can join us if you want.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;And why didn&#39;t I hear about this? I think that someone would praise. And definitely, I would notice if some girl&#39;s tits grew.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

The man smiled even wider.

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;You keep surprising me, milady. Indeed, most of the transformed people never saw this room. But those whose transformation occurred because of pact or they made a deal with the force you call &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; did. And as the transformation caused by the pact depended on the imagination of the changer... Well, there is no need to spend the chips on the changing of the appearance. Most people at this table use them in more subtle ways than &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; didn&#39;t change because of the pact,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you snapped back.

The fragile girl blushed.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;I did,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said. 

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.davidName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; chuckled.

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;It was a really old pact. But then there was one, a nerdy boy called &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; who was very determined to have a pussy rather than to be named that. So I have to wait... But finally, I always get what I want. Aren&#39;t you my slut, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She pulled a face.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Of course I am! Why the fuck do you keep asking?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;So, it&#39;s up to you, milady. You will watch this game for a while, but eventually, you can take care of your life. But with your intelligence, it would be a loss if you didn&#39;t play. So I&#39;ll pray that you&#39;d eventually change your mind.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You frowned.

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Pray? You?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, there are a lot of beings in the Universe that wanted to be worship. And could be really grateful to their followers... But we are wasting time! There are two rounds more!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;[[You watched the game.|Watch the game]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="358" name="Watch the game" tags="" position="25152,116" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; put the &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; card on the table and put three chips on it.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;I bet he will finally suck a cock,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said. &lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;What do you say, master?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

The man in the suit smiled slyly.

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;I agree. He struggled enough. It&#39;s time for some relief for him. I am in.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He added the other three chips, but the one stuck into his fingers. He hissed in pain. The chip started to emerge into his body.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh... The stake was too high,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; said lightly. &lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Do you want me to add something to the pool?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Do it quickly, you bitch!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he snapped back.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Ask politely, master... And give me one of your chips.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He looked at her angrily, then he said through the clenched teeth.

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Can you add a card, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;? Pretty please. I&#39;ll give you one of my chips in reward.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She giggled. She laid another card. There were her and two high school boys. She sucked them both.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;He will suck two of them. He&#39;ll explain to himself that it will be good money. My chip, master.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

The man pulled out the chip of his finger. You saw the deep wound where it was attached. He covered it with a handkerchief.

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Who would think, that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; stocks fell so quickly. &quot;&lt;/span&gt; he muttered. Then he smiled. &lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;The next round could be more intererested for you, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. Would you join us?

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; smiled at you in really nasty way.&lt;/p&gt;[[You decided to play.|You&#39;ll play]]

To your own surprise, you looked at &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; enlarged breasts. Of course, you were dreaming, but somehow you knew that they were real and she would wake up tomorrow as the Boob Fairy really visited her. You also knew that the appearance of the transformed people could be affected. You remembered &#39;&#39;Bimbo-&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. You couldn&#39;t be defenceless.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I will play with you,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said quietly. 

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.davidName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; smiled.

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, milady,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. &lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sit with us! You, unfortunately, have no cards except your own... yet. But I am sure it&#39;s just a matter of time you&#39;d put someone under your charm. You have also no chips, except...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

He closed his eyes and you felt that some force was touching you, embraced you. It was an unpleasant, filthy feeling. You felt even a little pain in your head. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.davidName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; opened his eyes.

You hesitated for a moment, but you put the card in front of you.

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;As we will bet on your actions, you couldn&#39;t hear what we would say,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. 

It was odd. You saw &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.davidName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; talking, but you couldn&#39;t see it. They place two chips each next to your cards.

&lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;So, that&#39;s it,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said will a wry smile. &lt;span class=&quot;davidtext&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t be surprised, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.

Nowadays, more and more fathers took parental leave, but those 15 years ago your father was a sensation and the object of jokes. But it worked. Your mother could make up the college and started her carrier. Your father cooked and cleaned and as a graphic, he didn&#39;t need a formal education to earn money.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Come here,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. He hugged &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; with one hand and reached out the second one to &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, who until that was observing this with a sadness at his always too serious face.

Mmm? &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;We don&#39;t listen to stupid people,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she muttered and giggled between sobs. Your father kissed her on the forehead. You smiled. He still repeated this &quot;golden rule&quot;. 

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s my clever girl! You can&#39;t do something if it is dangerous, if you are too young to do so, or you promise to not doing some things. But hey! Even if pirates haven&#39;t played with dolls yet, you&#39;ll be the first pirate who does. That&#39;s all. If people didn&#39;t do new things, we&#39;d still live in the caves.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;We are not them!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

He was holding this uncomfortable position for too long. When he wanted to stand up, he lost his balance and fell into the water with two squealing toddlers. There were a lot of screams and squashing. They had a great time.&lt;/p&gt;[[You woke up.|Your girly morning]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="362" name="Your girly morning" tags="" position="25470,466" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $routine = 0&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;cleanClothes $player&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your alarm beeped.

You were a girl!

It was that sudden, even exciting awareness which you could compare to the emotions that little children had on Christmas morning. Your mind was still sleeping, but one of its parts was already agitated. You were a girl...

You opened your eyes and pushed away a hair that fell on your face. You looked down at the gentle and soft bulge of your breasts. You couldn&#39;t see through them to look at your flat stomach, but you touched it delicately. You were aware that something was also flat. Your hand reached your crotch that felt so unfamiliar. Still lying, you lifted your leg and admired how smooth and delicate it was.

You were a girl.

That was strange and weird. You went to the toilet to pee. Such ordinary activity made you feel even weirder. It had nothing familiar with some kind of dream or fantasy. It was brutally real. Fact that the floor felt cold to your bare feet was even more disturbing that you had to sit to pee and the wiping was obligatory. Having a vagina could be part of the illusion, the tiles on your toilet were part of the real world.

You heard the snoring of both of your parents. Your parents snored only when they were drunk so you suspected that the party was good. You had a morning to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;[[You did something with your hair.|Do something with your hair]]

There were albums. When you opened one of them, you saw a lot of cards. There were a picture and a name on each of them. People on the cards were all teenagers, in high school age. You realized what you were watching. All of the Parity victims. They apparently couldn&#39;t be used in the game at the table, but they remained in some kind of archive. But what about the squeals?

You tried to hear something from the album you had in your hands but you couldn&#39;t. As you closed it and took another one, the squeals fell silent. It was frustrating. You missed something.

You suspected that your hair was alive, a swarming creature with a really nasty character. When you finished, you tied your hair with a hairband. Even you couldn&#39;t fuck it up.

You were a girl! Probably you would get used to it, but that was a strong sexual experience. An experience and a temptation. Your long hair, tickling your cheeks and neck. The bumps on your chest under your shirt. The smoothness of your skin. The softness of your buttocks. Everything affected you and affected the wetness and warmth between your legs.

Your hand reached your vagina. You rubbed gently your clitoris, feeling the relief and pleasure. With the second hand you squeezed your breasts and moaned quietly. Your own high voice made you even hornier. You put your middle and index finger to your vagina. You sighed. You tried the flexibility of your vaginal lips. They were so warm and sensitive. You started to think about puting there something else. Something bigger. You were pressing and touching. You felt the orgasm building in your body.

It was like a day-dream. You couldn&#39;t focus on any single imagination, but everything you were picturing made you feel better. You thought about &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; body and great time you had during the sex with her. You thought about &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; cock and how could end the situation in his flat, if you had a pussy then. You thought about porn videos you watched, those all hot women... and men. But mostly women. You had apot for watching teen girls masturbating and now... now you were that girl. It was the last thought before the fury of your touch caused that you barely thought.

When you came, you whimpered and moaned. Geez...

You were sure that in this variant of the reality, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; had more problems with her complexion. 

You decided to make it easy, you just used the face powder. The brush tickled you a little. You knew that girls could be laughed at if they used too much powder so you were careful. It wasn&#39;t much but you already looked a little better. You checked the time. Well, it lasted evidently too long.

You looked rather helplessly on the other accesiories. You barely knew the names of them. You knew that this pencil was for eyes and some kind of brush was for eyebrows. But that was it.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Those girls... Always late...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Fuck off.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He chuckled. You quickly pulled out your books and notebooks. Your new body distracted you. As you ran, some of your hair fell on your face. Your breasts were bouncing, your bra rubbed against your skin uncomfortably. Certainly, you fucked something up. On top of that, you almost break your nail. It wasn&#39;t a good start to this day.

It turned out that even your entrance didn&#39;t get your attention to your classmates. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; stole the show. You noticed that boys stared at her and evidently she was glad. When you looked at her, she smirked. She wore a quite revealing shirt, so you could see her bigger breasts. Still, her cleavage wasn&#39;t as impressive as &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; (or yours), but with her fragile posture, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; breasts were quite prominent. &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Caroline&#39;s breasts&quot;)&gt;&gt;You didn&#39;t doubt that your dreams were in fact a reality, but the seriousness of the situation hit you.

It was a disturbing thought. Anything that happened during those three days wouldn&#39;t end.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t stare. You shouldn&#39;t be jealous, you know.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You rolled your eyes. Then you looked at &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. She pretended that nothing happened, but she looked worried.

It turned out that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; breasts were the topic of your conversations. You talked about them to:&lt;/p&gt;[[$they.carlFemaleName|Slutty: talk with Caroline]]

You went to the girls&#39; locker room. However you wouldn&#39;t participate in the lesson, you decided to leave your stuff there. It was a strange experience to be with the girls during they were changing clothes. You felt like an intruder, and girls thought the same, as they seemed to be embarrassed in your presence. You sat aside.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;They are such prudes, aren&#39;t they?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; asked. She didn&#39;t feel confident in the center of attention, so she changed next to you. She had no shame. She took off her shirt and then a bra. You had a good view of her new more prominent breasts. She put on the sports bra and snorted. &lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;I bet &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; just compared the size of her new dick and she&#39;s just one of the boys now. But you and I need to earn our place in the pussy team. They think they are so better than us because they have cunts all their lives. Bitches.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;  

You were quite surprised. That was probably one of the longest conversations you had with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; or &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; that didn&#39;t end with an insult or bully.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;I have to say, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; impressed me. I expected that as soon as she shows you her dick she will force on you. &lt;&lt;if $firstCock ==true&gt;&gt;You know, the first dick you see can really mess up with your head.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You can&#39;t really resist the first dick you saw.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; You are lucky girl, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Ok, that was weird. There was something odd in her behavior. She looked worried and anxious, but still, she seemed to be very focused. You knew she wasn&#39;t your friend. But maybe it was a good thing to talk with her. You...&lt;/p&gt;[[...took advantage of her weakness.|Bully Caroline]]

She took the &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; usual place. He looked at you and her surprisingly and muttered:

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;So, you two fuck each other now or something?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She smiled slyly.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve just borrowed her for a moment.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He shrugged and took her place. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; sighed.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Look at her,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said looking at &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. &lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;You know that &quot;occult&quot; means &quot;hidden&quot; in Latin?

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;And now do you care, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;? No offence, but you seemed to be a cold bitch.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She smirked.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, I try to be. But when children play with matches, the innocent people can get hurt. So, tell me, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. Did you join the game last night?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;What?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Tell me.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
 
There was a power in her voice. The same power you felt during the Monday lesson when she made you admired her body.

He had to bring a projector and a screen there. He asked  you and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; to bring it back at the second floor. You did it before, but as you were a boy you had to lug the heavy projector. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; used to laugh at you mercilessly, so you grinned widely as &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; gasped.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Mmmm... What a strong man...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You knew I was always kind of feminist...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Really? You had no problem with me paying for your burgers. Looks like patriarchy to me. So, as you later will drag some female to your cave, you have to prove your masculinity.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He winced.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It really sounds bad, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I told you that every time you said that before,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you reminded him. He put the projector away for a moment. He made just one break, you used to need at least three. He was much stronger than you. He wiped the sweat from his brow. Then he looked at you surprisingly serious.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;But it was funny because you wouldn&#39;t drag me. You were not a real danger. But I... I could do it. I am strong enough. I actually can imagine myself doing it.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You looked at him carefully. He looked away and took the projector.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;This week is fucked up,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; muttered. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yet &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; tinkers in the Parity...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She pulled a face, then shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;carolinetext&quot;&gt;&quot;Cowardly bitches. They won&#39;t mess with me. When I&#39;ll change back, I could do what they deserve.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

But she didn&#39;t look convinced. You chuckled.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s your plan, right? Yeah, I want to see it happen. Sure, I get that &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; has two-ways tickets, but as you are fucking around you are losing everything, you know? Girls were scared of you, guys respected you.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.carlFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; made an angry face.

You couldn&#39;t tell, but you managed to show her fingers. It was a really hard thing to do.

&lt;span class=&quot;marthatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Ok, take a rest, girl. That&#39;s weird.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Why not?

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t use Tom&#39;s ballads against me!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You chuckled. No, actually you giggled. But then you got serious.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hey, that&#39;s OK. I used to blame you for many things in the last two days, remember? I was stupid. I trust you, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. I really do. You were a strong girl, you kicked asses without a physical advantage.

You looked him in the eyes. He relaxed a little and smiled.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure I am strong guy, but this projector is made of Kryptonite,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said and took it again. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Of course, the politicians had to do it with a huge bureaucracy - the employer had to pay all dues and the employee later had to apply for money in the local tax office.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;May I join you?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; asked.

He shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Nah. The Pope didn&#39;t move out, so it&#39;s not so much improvement like you think. Maybe I buy something. I&#39;ve earned some money too, you know. Maybe I won&#39;t spend it on the cigarettes.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You chuckled.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; used to laugh at your habit of buying a lot of books. It was a waste of money to him, as most of them you read only once.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Libraries are for poor people.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He rolled his eyes.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, mom,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he answered sacrastically. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Will you come this evening to me? Probably I would clean the flat then, but maybe I can use your help.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;ll see, but my father kicked me out, so... Well, we&#39;ll see.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Spending the whole day with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; wasn&#39;t really a nice perspective, as you would spend with him most of the weekend also.

It turned out that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; didn&#39;t intend to enter the shop. He ligthed a cigarette.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It looks like I have to start cleaning my flat myself,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said and sighed. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Will you join me in the evening at least?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I suppose,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said. &lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I can&#39;t stay home, so... Yeah, I think I will come.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

There was something unreal in this evening. You often looked in the mirror, fascinated by seeing a girl as your reflection.

Your parents would come back late. Being a local politician meant a lot of meetings and a lot of drinking. You bet your father built a positive image of your mother. They were a good team. She has determination and competencies, and he was charming and funny. And he raised here, in this district. There was some idiotic pride among the old townfolks, the councilmen that weren&#39;t born here rarely kept their mandates for more than one term of office. Your mother was finishing second.

You sighed. You knew that your mother would use you also to build her positive image. Luckily, you were 18 now, so you could drink. Being sober during those boring, pointless meetings was torture. You were sure that it would be harder to endure them as you were a girl. Those all old men and women were creepy. Social activists were odd kind of people. They weren&#39;t completely sane.

This evening was surprisingly calm. You were grateful for that. You felt a little relaxed. You took a long, hot bath that was another chance to look closer at your transformed body. Seeing your own breasts was still unbelievable, but as you were alone you were getting used to this sight. 

&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Text Dorothy&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if not visited(&quot;Don&#39;t text her&quot;)&gt;&gt;While you were scrolling Facebook you noticed &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; texted you back.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m so sorry, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. How you holding up? You can call me, if you want.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Maybe it was a time to call her?&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You remembered that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; text you back. Maybe it was a time to call her?&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[[Call her.|Call Dorothy]]&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;

You sighed, but with your higher voice it didn&#39;t sound like it used to. In many ways,  &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; would talk to you first time.

She picked up quickly.

&lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said. Her voice, quite low for a girl, was full of concern. 

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. It&#39;s been a while.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said quietly. You couldn&#39;t see her face, but you supposed she had to be surprised how girly you sounded. The deathly hush fell. &lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;How are you holding up? I know that in &#39;&#39;Rosset&#39;&#39; we all had to be ready for hugging, but... Well, it happened, so... I mean... You had a time to prepare as &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; were preparing to counter the ritual this creepy guy was trying to perform, but... But how do you feel, really?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You were surprised how uncertain she sounded. It wasn&#39;t &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; you knew.&lt;/p&gt;[[You told about yourself.|Talk openly with Dorothy]] &lt;&lt;quick $display&gt;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;I suppose... Eh, I&#39;m so sorry about you two. If you need some help in... You know, girl stuff, text me. I can help you.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks, but I don&#39;t think so it would be necessary,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you answer rather coldly. &lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Thankfully, I live in times when a girl can wear trousers.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, but those are still times when a girl has periods. Your mom might be rather surprised if her 18-year-old daughter asks questions about things she should know since middle school.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

There was a little sarcasm in her voice that made her sound more like she used to be. You were speechless for a moment. You didn&#39;t really think about your menstruation cycle.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Touché.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She giggled.

&lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;I want to say, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, that you are not alone. That&#39;s it.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Then you sighed.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; robbed me from my life, you know. I don&#39;t recognize myself in the mirror. There are... There are those thoughts that aren&#39;t mine. They seem to be put in my mind from the outside. I hardly know who I am...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; remained quiet for the moment.

&lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;I know, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. It&#39;s awful. &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; didn&#39;t change me in the way she changed you, but I can relate, believe me. How do your parents act?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, I&#39;m daddy&#39;s princess, apparently. And my mom... I don&#39;t know. She is the same.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, your dad must be crazy about his only daughter,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she chuckled. &lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, my God. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;! He has no clue, hasn&#39;t he?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah. Just like my parents.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;You poor thing. You must feel really lonely.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You expected the sarcasm, but you didn&#39;t found it. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; showed you compassion and concern. You knew she was able to show some feelings, but you didn&#39;t experience it often. But you were tired now. Hearing your own, high and sweet, girly voice was upsetting enough.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, I had better times, for sure... Listen, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. It&#39;s late and I have a hard day behind me... We&#39;ll see on Friday, at the concert. Goodbye.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. I&#39;m glad you called back. I... I missed you. Take care.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You sighed. You looked at yourself in the mirror. You saw a really tired and pale pretty girl. You clenched your teeth and took shorts and a t-shirt. You tried not to look at your body during the shower, but it was impossible. Your body responded to the hot water and soap.

Finally, you...
[[...fell asleep.|The first night]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You know I&#39;m not against girls,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said trying to be calm. &lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;And women are over half of the population and somehow they manage... So I&#39;ll live with it, I think.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She chuckled.

&lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;OK, that was something than only real &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; could say. So you are not an impostor. Wow. I mean, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was always a tomboy, so it wasn&#39;t a shock, but I hardly can imagine you with make up.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Or in a dress?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She giggled.

&lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;I definitely have to see that! If you need some guidance, let me know. Being a girl is more complicated than you think.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You sighed.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, I suppose. Thanks for the offer. I will probably need some help.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah? What does bother you most?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s not so simple to name one thing. That&#39;s the whole... experience. It&#39;s just overwhelming. I probably need someone who would help me with arranging the pieces.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;Eh, I can relate with that. Not in being a girl, but... generally. How do your parents act?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, I&#39;m daddy&#39;s princess, apparently. And my mom... I don&#39;t know. She is the same.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah. Just like my parents.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;You poor thing. You must feel really lonely.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ll survive... Listen, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. It&#39;s late and I have a big day behind me... We&#39;ll see on Friday, at the concert. Goodbye.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You remained silent for a moment.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;And what about you?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you asked. &lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;How do you holding up before the exams?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She hesitated for a moment.

&lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;Fine, I guess,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; she said rather weakly. &lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;Listen... Has &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; told you something about me?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Welcome commitee Olivier&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Not much. He... She said that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; helps you with the keeping &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; on the distance.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s something like that.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;No, he... she said nothing.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; sighed.

&lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, let&#39;s say that &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; didn&#39;t fuck off. Until I graduate, she would try to get me back to the &#39;&#39;Rosset&#39;s&#39;&#39;. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; helps me with keeping her on the distance.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You wondered how many things you missed yet.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You seem to know a lot about what happened to me. I mean, you know about the ritual and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.robertName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;... Did &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; or &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;... I mean, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; told you about it?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

It was none of her business, you would gladly add.

&lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, they are so sneaky about the &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;s&#39;&#39; things. But I was there when they realized that this guy was up to something. We were in &quot;Ground Zero&quot; when he showed up... You know what kind of the place &quot;Ground Zero&quot; is, don&#39;t you?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, it&#39;s a LGBT+ pub.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s nice place. And this guy was a total jock, so he didn&#39;t fit at all. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; got suspicious, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; listened him in. But I didn&#39;t know much. The girls don&#39;t trust each other. I didn&#39;t think you could be a victim...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You sighed. OK, you finally started to put some of the pieces together.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks for telling me. I am a little lost.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure. Listen, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;... I&#39;m glad you called me back.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

She said it very quickly, as she was afraid that she wouldn&#39;t be able to tell this if she would think more about it.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah... It&#39;s been a while. But we&#39;ll see each other on Friday, won&#39;t we?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;dorothytext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure we will! Take care.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Goodnight.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You laid on your bed and thought for a while. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was another piece of the puzzle. You thought that the Parity was a simple thing. It looked that it was far more complicated. You felt dizzy while you were thinking about the possibilities you could miss. Finally...&lt;/p&gt;[[...you fell asleep.|The first night]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="387" name="Bookshop creeps" tags="" position="26751,464" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#39;&#39;Mr. Zagorsky&#39;&#39; had two customers. &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;To the principal&#39;s office!&quot;)&gt;&gt;You recognize one of them immediately. It was this bald man who was in your principal&#39;s office.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;One of them was a bald man, unshaven and messy. He was talking loudly and evidently liked the sound of his own voice. You knew that type. Most of the people your mother worked with within the town hall were similar.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; The second customer was much younger, he was maybe two or three years older than you. He was bald too, but it was just a haircut. He looked out of place in the bookshop. He wore the t-shirt that said &quot;Death for enemies of Homeland&quot;. He was big and muscular and clearly with intelligence below the average.

As you went in, both of them looked at you. The older man quickly turned his head away, but the young Neanderthal stared at you with a wide smile, checking you out.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;O, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, good afternoon!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;Mr. Zagorsky&#39;&#39; exclaimed. He shook your hand quickly and nervously. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You are here for your certificate, aren&#39;t you? That young lady worked here for several months,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said to his customers. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;She was hardworking, trustworthy, and precise! This is the youth I was speaking of, &#39;&#39;Arthur&#39;&#39;. In each generation you could find loafers! Wait a minute, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, I have to find your papers...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He went to the back room, so you stayed with those two men. The older looked at you disrespectfully, the younger stared at your breasts. You tried to not show the anxiety you just felt.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I know you,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; the younger said and smiled widely. You looked at him surprised. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You are the chairwoman&#39;s girl. You were at the celebration of The Day of Independence.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He didn&#39;t sound so primitive like you assumed. But you didn&#39;t like his tone and look. The older man looked at you again and you saw the resentment on his face.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, it&#39;s //you//,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said and snorted. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;And //you// worked //here//, right? You have no shame, girl. Don&#39;t you have your own bookshops? I have to choose better place... Good bye, &#39;&#39;Sebastian&#39;&#39;. We&#39;ll see at the meeting.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He pulled a face and left. You were too shocked to react. But the younger man which you finally recognized as a member of the nationalist organization &quot;Our Legacy&quot; made this situation even weirder.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t worry about him. Old men have their quirks. I think lesbians are hot. They just didn&#39;t meet a real man.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;[[Your orientation wasn&#39;t his business.|Bookshop be offended]] &lt;&lt;forceful $display&gt;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;What the fuck that was supposed to mean?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you exclaimed.

His smile didn&#39;t disappear. In fact, he chuckled a little.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hey, girl, relax. I am on your side. You are not a commie hippie bitch, you just watch too much Netflix.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks for an advice. Now mind your fucking business.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

It was quite new to you. This guy could break you in one second, but still, you were sure that there wouldn&#39;t be a physical confrontation.

&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Bookshop with Olivier&quot;)&gt;&gt;That was the moment when &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; went to the bookshop. 

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Any problems here, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

The nationalist guy looked at him with a smile on his mouth.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Wow, original British desert combats. You see... &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. You just need to find a right man.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Fuck off!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

It was the moment when &#39;&#39;Mr. Zagorsky&#39;&#39; finally came back.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You wouldn&#39;t know how this conservation would end if &#39;&#39;Mr. Zagorsky&#39;&#39; didn&#39;t come from a back room.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&#39;&#39;Mr. Zagorsky&#39;&#39; came back with your papers and with a book. You were shocked that this primitive guy could read but it turned out that it was a present for some veteran. He paid and patted your shoulder.

&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Bookshop with Olivier&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Take care of your girl!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said to &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; and left.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Good luck, girl!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said and left.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Hands off!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;Mr. Zagorsky&#39;&#39; was a little embarrassed.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Election year!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he sighed. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;In the morning there were leftist activists and accused me of selling fascist books... But well, maybe I shouldn&#39;t tell you this. I hope you&#39;ll come and work for me during your vacation. I didn&#39;t believe that my back room could be so clean... Even a month, even a week! Whenever you want!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

You smiled. 

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ll see. You know, sir, the elections... It would be a busy time for my mother. But I&#39;d love to!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You talked with the old man for a moment, but your heart was racing. Finally...&lt;/p&gt;[[...you left a bookshop.|You lesbian?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="389" name="Bookshop ignore" tags="" position="26903,350" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $backto = &quot;Bookshop ignore&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $player.allowChangeApproach==1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $player.changeApproach = &quot;Careful&quot;&gt;&gt;

The guy was obviously checking you out. 

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, girls don&#39;t have easy times,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I would rather fuck girls too if I have to be with those all cuckolds and sissies. But don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll find a man. Just don&#39;t dye your hair on pink or something like those commie hippie whores.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You didn&#39;t know what to say, but finally, you looked at his face. He was evidently happy to advise the younger, pretty girl. You were sure that he would beat every cuckold or sissy he found. Well, maybe not everyone. The statistics of the physical violence in your country were still surprisingly low, but you were sure that some boys had to run before him and his friends.

&#39;&#39;Mr. Zagorsky&#39;&#39; came back with your papers and with a book. You were shocked that this primitive guy could read but it turned out that it was a present for some veteran. He paid and patted your shoulder.

Apparently, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; sent more photos than &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; did. Finally you were two years ago. 

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was your first girlfriend, you were her first boyfriend. That was a serious announcement of adulthood, so you did a lot of photos.

And &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; were the same. Shit.

You looked at the photos. Two schoolgirls were kissing passionately.

And of course, the photo where you were nearly making out with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; showing the middle finger...

There were yet a dozen similar photos, but you didn&#39;t check. Well, apparently the only serious relationship you had was lesbian. You had nothing against lesbians, or gays, or any other kinds of relationships. But you lived in the less tolerant place in Europe. You felt sorry for all transformed boys who appeared to be gays before the transformation. As for girls was mainly vocal harassment, for boys the danger was physical.

You came home quickly, feeling a sudden lack of safety. It turned out that...
[[...uncle Stan waited for you.|Uncle Stan without Olivier]]&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You left the bookshop very quickly. You were silent but irritated. Around the corner you erupted:

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Am I a lesbian?!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Some passer-by looked at you, but exclaiming schoolgirls were too trivial to stop. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; smirked.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Every pretty girl must be lesbian. Eh, be a man in the twenty-first century...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Be serious! My mother is a public person! I AM a public person! Am I on some nationalist page as a whore and slut?! Shit! Look at this!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You checked your Facebook profile and photos. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was your first girlfriend, you were her first boyfriend.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I am not really into lesbian porn, you know...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, I know. You prefer shemales.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He chuckled but blushed a little. Then he changed the subject, of course.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;And if you are on some fap-to-the-flag group, what then? Calm down. Primitives like them think that girls grow up from homosexuality. Many girls in middle school and high school are so attached to their female friends that they look like lesbians even if they are not. It would be enough to hang out with some guy and you remain the //normal// part of the society,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said with sarcasm and snorted. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Honestly, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, it&#39;s below you. You know the country you live in. I worry more about &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; than you. She actually is a lesbian and &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; makes her coming out much wider than she wants to.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

You were angry as your problems were ignored, but when he said about &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, you forgot about your anger. You bulged your eyes out.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;What? A lesbian? But she... But we...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; chuckled.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Relationship with you convinced her that she is into girls. I bet it would be a blow to your manhood, if... well... you didn&#39;t survive deeper blows.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You were shocked. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; hugged you and stroked your head.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Come on, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. I will walk you home where everyone loves you and accepts you regardless who you are.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

There was little bitterness in his voice.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Uncle &#39;&#39;Stan&#39;&#39; hugged you. He was a huge man, tall and fat. But the biggest part of him was his heart. You&#39;d never seen him sad or angry. His chubby face was hairless, even his eyebrows were barely visible. He looked at you with pure delight.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I know because &#39;&#39;Julie&#39;&#39; still reminds me that girls nowadays don&#39;t want to be complimented by old, creepy men, but forgive your godfather... You are extremely beautiful young woman, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&#39;&#39;Julie&#39;&#39; was his 14-year-old daughter. You actually blushed a little. You always had good contact with uncle &#39;&#39;Stan&#39;&#39;, but his enthusiasm a little embarrassed you. He shook his hand with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, who smiled widely.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;When the fuck did you grow so tall, pardon my French,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;Stan&#39;&#39; exclaimed. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; after his transformation had equal height.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Lately,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he answered with a smirk.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I hope you remind my goddaughter how pretty she is,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;Stan&#39;&#39; said with fake sternness. Now you felt your ears were burning.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure thing! Everytime I want to borrow money from her. Don&#39;t I, gorgeous?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

He actually stroke your hair. &#39;&#39;Stan&#39;&#39; laughed loudly.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s my man!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Ok, that&#39;s enough,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; your father said, entering the hall. You knew that he was one year older than &#39;&#39;Stan&#39;&#39;, but he looked 10 or 15 years younger. He smiled at you with sympathy. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Just give her presents, &#39;&#39;Stan&#39;&#39;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, sire! I hope you&#39;ll like them. &#39;&#39;Julie&#39;&#39; chose them, of course, because I would ruin your birthday. I regret I couldn&#39;t give you them in January, but well... The emigrant&#39;s fate.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He gave you a box. You all went to the living room and you unpacked it. There were a bottle of wine, golden earrings in the shape of a clover, and fitting other jewelry: the necklace and the bracelet. You found also the most Irish t-shirt you saw. There was a leprechaun with a rainbow in the background with a beer in his hand. It wasn&#39;t a cheap souvenir. It was clearly a hand-painted little masterpiece. Your eyes went wide. 

Before you could stop yourself, you jumped to &#39;&#39;Stan&#39;&#39; and kissed him on the cheek. It was so girly behavior that it was surprised you and even embarrassed you. You saw &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; grinning. 

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Do us a favor and wear it!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;Stan&#39;&#39; said. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;Julie&#39;&#39; wants to know if she chooses the right size. She was stalking your accounts in the Internet for a while.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

You wondered if &#39;&#39;Julie&#39;&#39; saw your photos with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;O, and the meantime, as we will wait for a lady, this boy could play and sing for us! Come on, &#39;&#39;Pete&#39;&#39;, give him &#39;&#39;Victor&#39;s&#39;&#39; guitar.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Your father frowned and hesitated for a moment, but he gave &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; the instrument that occupied the place of honor in the living room.

You were surprised how well-fitting was your new t-shirt. The women&#39;s t-shirts generally didn&#39;t fit well, but this underlined your body shape perfectly. And this leprechaun had everything to match with a stereotypical Irish culture. As you wore a bracelet, you felt you were dressed properly for the concert.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; as a girl had nice voice, but it was nothing special. She tried to sound like Dolores O’Riordan, but she didn&#39;t have that power.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I swear &#39;&#39;Julie&#39;&#39; has a measure in the eye!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he exclaimed. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Forgive again the old man, but you really look gorgeous, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Damn, you have no idea how I miss you all guys! Your parents and you, of course, but even your friends! I recently found the photos from our vacation two years ago! My God, how funny they were.

Hetook the guitar with the prayerful respect. You knew how he was always admiring it. As your father cared about her and tuned everyday, he just needed a little time to start playing. As &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; heard the sound of the instrument, he had a wide smile on his face.

He started to play. You recognized the tune immediately, so as your father and uncle &#39;&#39;Stan&#39;&#39;. Your father smiled. &quot;The Heaven on their minds&quot;.

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; liked and admired your father and he was aware how this proposition hit him. So he said quickly:

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Nonsense, my boy!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &#39;&#39;Stan&#39;&#39; exclaimed. He smiled to you father. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Come on, &#39;&#39;Pete&#39;&#39;. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; plays this guitar better than &#39;&#39;Victor&#39;&#39; did. There are plenty ways to show respect to the dead. It would be &#39;&#39;Victor&#39;s&#39;&#39; legacy.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

Your father cleared his throat. He was clearly touched. 

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t say &quot;no&quot;, really,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said and smiled weakly, looking at &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It just surprised me, that&#39;s all. I will think about it. You play really good,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he praised &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, but he took the guitar very quickly.

&#39;&#39;Stan&#39;&#39; looked at you with delight on his fat face.

&lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Damn, you have no idea how I miss you all guys! Your parents and you, of course, but even your friends! I recently found the photos from our vacation two years ago! My God, how funny they were. And that boy with glasses finally found a girl!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he repeated. &lt;span class=&quot;maletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I remember that we owed each other that we would recapture him from a seminary!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he laughed.

Your father took him to the living room. Yes, you remembered that. &#39;&#39;Uncle Stan&#39;&#39; couldn&#39;t accept &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; plans and he was vigorously supported by &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;.

He was the only one of your closest friends that thought that you always were a girl. You had to admit that your friendship with him was something you wanted to repeat in your relationship with the woman of your life. You supported each other and understood easily. Now you were a girl.

You thought about his smile, his calmness, and his constant willingness to help. You saw many times how he was charming the animals. Your heart melted sometimes even if you were with no doubt a heterosexual boy.

But now? You realized that the certain memories were coming back. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; in the tent you both shared during the mountain trip two years ago, sleeping only with his boxers. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; naked when you both tried to clean in the terribly cold, mountain stream. You even had earlier memories from the scout camps when you shared a shower. There was nothing sexual in them, you were far too young then to made you feel something that way. But there was something intimate in them. You felt close to &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; and this feeling had a physical aspect. You wondered how could feel his mild touch on your face. You thought how would taste his lips during the kiss. And certainly, you wanted to stroke his unruly hair.

You realized that &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; had a girlfriend but surprisingly you didn&#39;t feel weird that you were daydreaming about your childhood friend who just managed to get a steady relationship in his life. For those couple of days, you had so many crazy thoughts that this one appeared to be the most innocent among them. You weren&#39;t sure what you wanted to do with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. It was just a thought. And as you weren&#39;t demonic being as &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39;, your thoughts couldn&#39;t shape the reality of other people... Could they?

But for now you had to make other decission. Did you help &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;...&lt;/p&gt;[[...to clean his flat?|Help Olivier?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="397" name="You are not interested in Justin" tags="" position="27776,525" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You didn&#39;t really want to change the relation you had with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. Of course, he was a boy (and a cute one) and you were a girl now, but you surely would remain friends&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Struggle&quot;)&gt;&gt;. Maybe you&#39;d reconsider this because he certainly could keep it in his pants and as you wanted to change back, maybe hanging out with him would avoid many problems. But it would be using him.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was raised in the dysfunctional family. You weren&#39;t sure if he handled his traumas better than &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. You were pretty sure that she was sane until you became her boyfriend. Being closer to &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was a risk you didn&#39;t really want to take. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was your friend and you didn&#39;t want to lose him. It seemed that keeping a healthy distance was a good solution to preserve your friendship.

Besides, your current position, permanent or not, was an opportunity to meet other people. You were a pretty girl. Your possibilities to make new relations got wider. You lived in a big city. You were finally an adult. Why would you limit yourself to people you already knew?

And he had a girlfriend. A rich girl from a Catholic family, equally engaged in the community like he was. It was a foreign world for you. You couldn&#39;t accept and support him in his way and choices. It would be wise to let things be like they were already.

You sighed. Maybe you weren&#39;t interested in &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; in //that// way, you certainly missed him.

As he was always lazy, you were sure that it would take most of the evening, but to your surprise he cleaned most of it earlier. You realized that he really cared. He wanted to host  &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; and his girlfiend. You knew they were close.

So you just helped him with throwing rubbish and to move some of the heavier furniture to their proper place. You were rather a symbolic help. So there was a whole evening ahead of you.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I should call my parents... They want to know that I cleaned a flat for a good, young Christian. It would take a while. Can you buy us some beer in the meantime?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;[[Sure.|Buy beer]]

The evening was warm and pleasant. You took the headphones into your ears and launched Spotify.

The park seemed to crowdy for you, so you decided to go to the river. Riverbank on this side was still wild and neglected. There was a path for cyclists and walkers and several beaches where people set campfires, but most of the area was covered by high grass, bushes, and trees. Some people jogged here or even were fishing, but it was calm and quiet. You needed such relaxation.

As your city was surrounded by woods, the boars were a solid problem for evening walkers. You didn&#39;t meet them, but you heard them, so you decided to climb on the embankment. You had a great view of the center&#39;s panorama with its skyscrapers and lights. On the other side, you saw the chimneys of mostly closed factories. And in the middle of those sights of the modern city, you were in the wilderness only with boars and birds. The contrasts in your city never stopped to surprise you. But then, when you followed the path through the embankment you realized it was a good allegory of your own life. Was there any barrier that could stop &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39;? The flashy of the center was certainly across the river of your doubts and fears. And you were terribly alone there.

You sighed. Your loneliness was complete. You turned around, but you only heard the noises of cars crossing the bridge. You knew this area, you were here quite often. But then, at this moment, it seemed to be unfriendly, even dangerous. You stopped, unsure of what to do. You didn&#39;t want to be alone. You wanted to have someone with you. You took your phone. The call seemed to be better than nothing. You called...&lt;/p&gt;[[$they.justinName|Call Justin]]

It was quite crowdy, as it was placed next to the station. People from suburbs usually shopped here before they went home.

It was the first time since your transformation you could mingle with the crowd. Finally, you got some privacy. Of course, as a young woman, you weren&#39;t as invisible as you were before, but you were still more comfortable than you were at school. Some people stared at you because they saw a cute girl, not that you were transformed into one.

It was odd just to walk into the mall without a purpose. You were passing shops and you were looking at the displays. You realized that you didn&#39;t notice many of them before. They used to be just elements of the decoration in your way to your destination. Now you were looking at them with newly finding interesting. What would you have to buy?

Well, you had a lot of time, so you could actually enter those shops and looked around. You decided to look at...&lt;/p&gt;[[...books, of course.|Books]]
[[...clothes.|Clothes]]
[[...perfumes and cosmetics.|Perfumes and makeup]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="402" name="Clothes" tags="" position="28241,112" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;displaytext&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;feminineHabits $player&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You didn&#39;t think before how many shops with clothes were in a single gallery. But there were plenty of them and most of them offered the women&#39;s clothes. The underwear, the undershirts, dresses, blouses, trousers, skirts, dresses... There was a whole world you didn&#39;t discover before. You were in a mall with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.dorothyName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; several times, but you were just a bored intruder. When you passed one of the malls, you realized that you wouldn&#39;t be able to choose anything. As a boy, you had just to find the proper size. There, as a girl, you had to consider a lot of elements. Your general body shape, the size of your breasts, the size of your waist... And the clothes should match some style or color. In sudden illumination you realized that even  &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, who showed a contempt to clothes, was a very consistent in her choices.

You sighed. Of course, there were shop assistants who would gladly help you, but you weren&#39;t ready. That was overwhelming and challenging. You probably should take a company on your first shopping.

As you were wandering through the corridors of the gallery, you realized that you paid attention to the girls and women but in the other way. You noticed how they were dressed.

You spent some time in the mall, but eventually, you get bored. You received some messages. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; informed you about his train&#39;s arrival. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; asked you if you would come.

You weren&#39;t really in the mood for shopping when you went to &#39;&#39;Mr. Zagorsky&#39;s&#39;&#39; place, but now you were. You went to the horror section. As always, you were surprised about the amount of discounted books. You sometimes bought one of them, however, they were often a total crap. As your father was a graphic, you could recognize the stock pictures used on the covers. They barely fit the content of the books. Most of the books were translations of American authors. The horror writers in your country had a little chance to be published in the bigger publishing houses. 

But there was an exception. You saw a book titled &quot;The recognition of spirits&quot;. The stock blond and busty teenage girl was shouting on the cover. But there was a subheading that you found interesting. &quot;Is your high school cursed too&quot;? 

You took the book. The author was from your city and it was his debut as a fiction writer but he published already some articles about occultism. It turned out that the plot of his book was about the cursed school where some kind of evil spirits persuaded students to commit suicide.

Well, it was interesting. The occult writers usually wrote terribly. You tried to read some classics of the matter, but you didn&#39;t learn much. And as the book cost $2.50, you didn&#39;t hesitate long.

You even went into some, trying to name some types of cosmetics and perfumes. The number of choices was overwhelming. You had earlier just a soap and hair shampoo. You didn&#39;t know what the conditioner was or why you shouldn&#39;t clean your hands with ordinary soap. You were shocked how many colors of nail polish you could buy.

Of course, you didn&#39;t buy anything. You didn&#39;t know what you have in your own bathroom. You weren&#39;t sure if you really wanted to use those cosmetics. But awareness of their existence was the great discovery of this day. As a boy, you just didn&#39;t care. But now you somehow knew that regardless you used them or not, you&#39;d be judged by other girls. You knew that appearance was a key to respect. If you didn&#39;t gain some respect, the next year would be unpleasant.

You sighed. Damn double standards.

You chuckled. 

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I had to go into the temporary exile. Uncle &#39;&#39;Stan&#39;&#39; occupies my flat. He sends his regards to you and your lady, by the way.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;claudiatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Honey, who you&#39;re talking to?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you heard the girl&#39;s voice in the distance.

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. She says hi.&quot; &lt;/span&gt;

You didn&#39;t, but you were surprised to hear the sudden tension in &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.justinName&gt;&gt;&#39;s&#39;&#39; voice.

&lt;span class=&quot;claudiatext&quot;&gt;&quot;Cool. Shouldn&#39;t you finish your packing, darling? We&#39;ll have no time tomorrow.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s not a North Pole expedition, I will do it in the minute.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You noticed the familiar tone of his stubbornness. But you were surprised he was using it in the conversation with his girlfriend.

&lt;span class=&quot;justintext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m sorry, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.femaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. The trip business.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

The packages from a catering and empty wine bottles occupied a part of the hall. You quietly came to your room. The guest was still there, but apparently, nobody noticed that you came back. That was good. You liked &#39;&#39;Stan&#39;&#39;, but you had enough of your own thoughts to think about.

You should be excited about tomorrow&#39;s concert. How simple a life you had before this week! It wasn&#39;t perfect, sure, but it was predictable. And even if you liked adventures, you felt overwhelmed. You needed time to think, you needed time to tame the situation. To restore a balance in your life, disturbed by breasts and wide hips.

You heard a burst of laugher. Even your mother laughed. Well, you had hope that that accusation of being a lesbian wouldn&#39;t cost her next term of office as a chairwoman. 

You knew that this night would be calm. No more dreams for the next three days! But even those several hours later, when you finally went to bed you had a hunch that someone was observing you.

You were proud whenever the shopkeeper didn&#39;t ask you for your ID. But this time you were checked really carefully. Didn&#39;t you look for 18 years old? Probably not.

When you went with beer, you thought about your alcohol experiences. You were a normal teenager, so you drank some beer and vodka since middle school. You could drink much without getting drunk. You were curious if that remained the same after your transformation. Probably not. You didn&#39;t have the mass that would give you more endurance... You sighed. You had to discover so many things about yourself...

Well, one thing you discovered quite quickly.

When &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; opened you a door, he was in undershirt and shorts. You looked at his muscular arms and legs and you had to admit that you liked them. It wasn&#39;t envy, though. At this moment you couldn&#39;t imagine those muscles on your body. You just enjoyed the view. They were attractive.

&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Struggle&quot;)&gt;&gt;You clenched your teeth. &#39;&#39;Auntie&#39;&#39; was messing with you again, but you decided to struggle with those temptations. You wouldn&#39;t accept that you were attracted to boys.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;It was a new experience to you, finding the guy attracted.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

The music played in the background. Tom Waits sang that he&#39;d sell your heart to the junkman for a buck.&lt;/p&gt;[[You stepped in.|Alone with Olivier]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="409" name="Don&#39;t buy beer" tags="" position="28172,915" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Struggle&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;displaytext&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;anger $auntie&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since you could buy alcohol legally, you had a great temptation to buy it constantly. When you passed the malls, you hesitated for a moment, but your will was strong. There would a whole weekend ahead of you.

You weren&#39;t surprised that his room didn&#39;t change because of his transformation. You never asked &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; about her dreamly room. She seemed to have no attachment to the space.
 
&lt;&lt;if not visited(&quot;Uncle Stan with Olivier&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I bet you have a room worth a princess,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure. I even have a stuffed unicorn, so I will never be lonely. And a mirror. A big one.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He chuckled.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I always wondered why you didn&#39;t have one as you were a boy. You spent a lot of time in the bathroom, I suppose. Admiring yourself. Train one-liners.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;You are a daddy&#39;s girl now, aren&#39;t you? And god daddy&#39;s girl for certain. My God. &#39;&#39;Stan&#39;&#39; was totally under your spell!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

You rolled your eyes and sighed. He chuckled.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I still can&#39;t believe how natural you look and act. Really, don&#39;t blush. I watched you. You are far more natural than &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.marthaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. She tries too hard. She acts. I bet she still drown her inner nerd out.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Accept fate&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;So you say I&#39;m some kind of sissy or something?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;No. I say you can have a normal life. I hope we both will have but as I watch you, you are better than I.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You frowned.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you hissed through the clenched teeth. &lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I might be hugged but I am the same person I was! Nothing changed inside me, understood?!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He looked at you a little surprised.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $you.maleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;. I&#39;m just messing with you, relax.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;No funny.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You pouted your lips. That was so feminine mannier, that you winced when you realized what did you do.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

You realized that it was the first moment when you were alone with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; after you both changed. But your body noticed it earlier. You felt a little dizzy. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was close. You never kept a social distance with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;, so it wasn&#39;t inappropriate that as a boy she sat so close. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaFemaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; didn&#39;t attract you, but &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;... did. You smelled the smell of his cosmetics. You looked at his hands. They seemed to be larger than you had as a boy, but comparing to your fragile palms you felt so small and vulnerable. But yet you felt safe and warm. You looked at his face and realize that you liked the sparkles in his eyes and you liked his wry smile.

He looked at you but quickly looked away. He looked conflicted. As you saw the bulge in his pants, you thought you discovered the source of this conflict. &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Struggle&quot;)&gt;&gt;That thought scared you.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
 
&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Buy beer&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Why aren&#39;t we drinking?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he exclaimed, hiding his confusion. He efficiently opened the two bottles of beer and gave you one. He raised his and said:

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;To the new beginnings!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

He changed a position a little so you couldn&#39;t see his erection so vividly.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;He sighed. He changed a position a little so you couldn&#39;t see his erection so vividly.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;My parents aren&#39;t here and I have to be sober! Promise me that tomorrow at this hour we&#39;ll be drunk!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 

You chuckled.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;The concert will last then, but later... Everything could happen,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said slyly. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; looked at you and then you saw the excitement in his eyes.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;hintboxOwn&quot;&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Sex with &lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;&lt;/div&gt;Your &#39;&#39;Condition&#39;&#39; + base relation with &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;/

So you talked about movies and music. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; showed you some new melodies he composed. Even as a girl he had long fingers, now he had even longer, so he could play better. It was nice to hear him and he was really excited.

You talked about the vacation too. You supposed you both would work, as your parents didn&#39;t have or didn&#39;t want to give you money. You complained a little that your parents were skimpy, but you both had so good experiences with your first jobs, so it wasn&#39;t last long. 

You felt a little relaxed during this evening. It was... well... another evening of your life but after your change, it meant a lot. You felt you restored some control over your life.

Finally, you had to come back home. You stood on your toes and kissed his cheek. You came home smiling.&lt;/p&gt;[[At home.|Go home]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="412" name="Be seducive to Olivier" tags="" position="28512,870" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You leaned against the wall and lightly spreaded your legs. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; could have a good view on your figure. 

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Damn, you are beautiful...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You smiled wryly. You pushed away your hair.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;And you are the same you used to be... Don&#39;t you regret? You could look like a young Al Pacino or something.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

He shrugged.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s my life, not some kind of the freak show. I like who I am.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

His self-confident and self-awarness impressed you. You smirked.

He chuckled and leaned closer to you.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I was surprised, that&#39;s all.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You leaned on your hands, so your face was closer to him.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Was it a pleasant surprise?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you whispered.

He kissed you and after the short moment you were kissing him back. He touched your chin, you stroke his head. Your tongues met each other. You were feeling hot. You kissed him passionately and you knew it was just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;[[You let him to explore your body]]

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; sighed. You knew it was the first time for him and that made you excited. You were happy you were his first girl. As a girl, he was far more experienced than you. Now you were equal. 

You licked his penis. The musky taste was odd, but you thought it would be worse. You were licking delicately, stopping for a moment and looked up at his face.

It was incredible. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; was far bigger than you. You felt so small in his company. Yet you controlled him completely and used that power to bring him joy. You loved how hoarsely he breathed. You felt excited seeing him clenching his fists and biting his lips. You stopped for a moment and smiled mischievously. He smirked. Then you continued, barely touching his penis with your tongue. He shivered. You wanted to hear his moan. When you lightly touched his balls, he gasped. Then finally he moaned.

You giggled and sucked him more vigorously. You were licking for a whole length of his cock. Once he let a moan escape, he couldn&#39;t resist. His moaning made you terribly wet.

Finally, he came. You were splashed with his warm sperm, sticking to your cheeks and lips. He gasped and sat down on the bed. He looked at you and smiled.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;That was incredible... You were incredible...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You smiled widely and kissed him deeply. He touched your breast and squeezed. Now it was your time to moan.

&lt;span class=&quot;yourfemaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I have to clean up your mess,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; you said slyly. 

You came to the bathroom and saw your reflection in the mirror. You barely got used to seeing a girl&#39;s face, now this face was covered in the cum. What a week...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The end of chapter 4&lt;/h4&gt;[[End for now!|Chapter 4 summary]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="414" name="You let him to explore your body" tags="" position="28665,909" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $count = $count+1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $relations.Olivia=$relations.Olivia+2&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You started to undress smiling slyly. &#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; rolled his eyes.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;What&#39;s your rush?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he asked. He took your hands and squeezed. Then he let you go and corrected the strap of your bra. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Take your time. You&#39;re a girl now. You can be more subtle.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

It was really strange. You were horny as hell and impatient. As you watched the bulge in his pants, he wanted you as well, but he clearly enjoyed the foreplay. He was gentle and delicate. He was kissing you deeply, his hands were wandering through your body. He carefully avoided your breasts but touched your stomach just next to them. He put his hands into your &lt;&lt;print $lowerbodyOn&gt;&gt;, but didn&#39;t touch &lt;&lt;print $pantiesOn&gt;&gt;. He touched your back, stroking the straps of your bra. And he still focused on your ears. He was caressing them, kissing them, pinching them, and even biting a little. And that was really intensive. Your hard nipples and moist vagina were radiating with pleasure, even he didn&#39;t touch them. You moaned a little and he chuckled.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I knew you were ear person,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he whispered slyly, stroking your hair. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I wonder where you are ticklish. Hey, hands off! You naughty girl...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

You wanted to reach his pants but he didn&#39;t let you. You wanted to take the initiative because you were so close. You wanted to go further. How would it look like if you came just after he touched you in some places and licked your ears? That was embarrassing. But apparently, that was his idea. And you couldn&#39;t complain, really. When he finally touched your breasts through the fabric of your &lt;&lt;print $undershirtOn&gt;&gt;, you moaned again. 

&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;print $they.oliviaMaleName&gt;&gt;&#39;&#39; touched your crotch in the last moment. Your world exploded with bliss. You laid on the back, panting. He played with your hair, grinning. 

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Fresh, virgin girl,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; he said slyly. &lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;Fucking you right now would be a profanation.

&lt;span class=&quot;oliviamaletext&quot;&gt;&quot;I was glad to help. Now I need to change my boxers. God, boys are so easy... Where is fun, if you have to operate only on the cock?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
