		<h1>So, you want to write some stuff for AW.<small><br>
		Ultimate grammar incoreectly written Besty guide!</small></h1>
		<p>
		First and foremost, thank you! AW is heavily oriented for user content and modding and with your events we will fill the game with cool lewds much faster! The process is pretty simple actually, you don't need any coding skills, just an ability to form coherent thoughts and a little bit of attention to details. And of course your perverted fantazy! This guide covers only basics you need to know to start slapping your content, more specific information is in another guides you can find in the folder. :D So, let's begin!
		<p>

		<h3>POV</h3>
		Everything must be written in current tense from the second-person view (author describes things happening with the player to the player).
		<div class="example"><div class="thingie good">✔</div>
			When you arrive at the office, Mademoiselle Souillon, still a beautiful woman in her mid-40s, and the CEO of her company greets you. She starts to give you and two other new hires what she calls "a brief introduction".
		</div>
		<div class="example"><div class="thingie bad">✖</div>
			<i>Miss Fuckface</i> arriv<i>ed</i> to the cave full of tentacles. After they molest<i>ed</i> her young holes, fill<i>ed</i> her with tentacle cum and dispos<i>ed</i> her in the the swamp. 
		</div>

		<h3>Never assume</h3>
		Thou shall not imply that playable character has any special traits or body. Standard text must be "personality neutral" with optional lines possible with "if" construction. (A bit later we'll talk about it too.).
		<div class="example"><div class="thingie good">✔</div>
			Mr. Smith touches your boobs with his hand while still slapping your ass with his palm and you moan against your will.
		</div>
		<div class="example"><div class="thingie bad">✖</div>
			Mr. Smith touches your big <i>round</i> boobs with his hand while still slapping your <i>tiny boyish</i> ass with his palm and you cry <i>@@.pc;Take your hands off me you sick fuck!@@</i>.
		</div>
		<h3>Speech markup</h3>
		Also, did you just notice this wierd @@.pc; thingy? This way we mark up PC's speech so it will be that pink coursive in the game! Dont forget to put @@ at the end!
		<div class="example">
			@@.pc;Pc says!@@.<br>
			@@.npc;NPC says!@@.<br>
			@@.mono;PC internal monologue (thoughts)@@.<br>
		</div>
		Also pls, start all above thingies from new line for easier reading in editor. 
		<h3>Basic event markup</h3>
		Every scene starts with some Twine markup looks like this:
		<div class="example">
			:: SceneName-1 [nobr]<br><br>Scene content goes here.
		</div>
		We can have as many scenes in our event as we like, look:
		<div class="example">
			:: SceneName-1 [nobr]<br><br>Scene content goes here.<br><br>:: SceneName-2 [nobr]<br><br>Content for second scene goes here...<br><br> :: SceneName-2 [nobr]<br><br>And third one....
		</div>
		So, let's try to write some simple event!
		<div class="example">
			:: DildoScene-1 [nobr]<br><br>You are walking along the road while you notice some weird object on the concrete sidewalk.<br><br>@@.mono;Interesting, what is it?@@<br><br><br>:: DildoScene-1-Look [nobr]<br><br>You approach the thing and take a better look. It is about 12 inches long and flesh colored.<br><br>@@.mono;Wow it seems somebody lost their dildo, ha-ha!@@<br><br>You take it in your hand to inspect it and hear some voice from behind.<br><br>@@.npc;Hey, did you find it? Thank god!@@<br><br>You turn around and see a woman in her 20 running to you.<br><br>@@.pc;Oh it is yours?@@<br><br>@@.npc;Yeah, I was really worried I lost Arnold! I can't get asleep without it since I am 16!.<br><br><br> :: DildoScene-1-Away [nobr]<br><br>You ignore the object and go away.<br><br><br>:: DildoScene-1-Steal [nobr]<br><br>@@.pc;No way, It is mine now!@@<br><br>You run from the shocked girl with rubber dick in your hand shaking it triumphantly.<br><br><br>:: DildoScene-1-Return [nobr]<br><br>@@.pc;Oh, then here, take it!@@<br><br>You handle the dildo back to the girl and she looks really happy.<br><br>@@.npc;Oh, thank you very much! Oh Arnold, now lie still in the purse, Mommy will wash you and take good care of you, poor boy! Mommy will warm you up in Mommy's secret places in the evening...@@<br><br>With rised eyebrows you see the girl going away still talking to her dildo.
		</div>
		<h3>Linking</h3>
		Seems okay, but there is no linking between scenes. How do we go from :: DildoScene-1 to let's say, the :: DildoScene-1-Away? Easy peasy! There are different options. First, is suitable for the situations where there is basically no choice, you just want to split the event in two or more parts for better reading or there is a change in place or time. You can add as much links as you want one after another.
		<div class="example">
			&lt;&lt;link "Open the door"&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;go "ExampleEvent-42"&gt;&gt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;
		</div>
		Got what we did there? We wrapped "&lt;&lt;go" command into the "&lt;&lt;link" so it will only fire when "&lt;&lt;link" is clicked. Easy, as I said.<p>Btw, don't forget - every macro must end with &gt;&gt;!
		<div class="example"><div class="thingie good">✔</div>
			&lt;&lt;link "Open the door"&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;go "ExampleEvent-42"&gt;&gt;/link&gt;&gt;<p>
		</div>
		<div class="example"><div class="thingie bad">✖</div>
			&lt;&lt;link "Open the door"&lt;&lt;go "ExampleEvent-42"&gt;&gt;/link&gt;&gt;<p>
		</div>
		Okay, now second, more complicated option, dialogchoice. As you can assume it is used for dialogues. Here it goes:
		<div class="example">
			&lt;&lt;dialogchoice&gt;&gt;<br>
			&lt;&lt;dbutt "Enter"&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;go "ExampleEvent-42"&gt;&gt;<br>
			&lt;&lt;dtext "happy"&gt;&gt;Open the door<br>
			&lt;&lt;dbutt "Stay"&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;go "ExampleEvent-43"&gt;&gt;<br>
			&lt;&lt;dtext "sad"&gt;&gt;Don't do it<br>
			&lt;&lt;/dialogchoice&gt;&gt;<br>
		</div>
		The thing is macro goes with two lines for each option, &lt;&lt;dbutt and &lt;&lt;dtext. &lt;&lt;dbutt contains a short name for action like "enter" or "stay" or "laugh" or whatever. Then we use our old friend, &lt;&lt;go macro that will shoot on clicking the option.<p>On the next line there is dtext which contains "happy" or "sad". It is the name of emojy that will be shown on the button. So you can add some more emotional iformation to the choice with this small face. Here goes the list of the names for emojis:<p>
		<img src="EMOJI-GUIDE.png">
		<p>
		Next goes the longer description for action like "Open the door" or something. And in the end we wrap it up with &lt;&lt;/dialogchoice&gt;&gt; I am pretty sure there is more info on this somewhere in the files but this pretty much covers the basics of linking for now.<p>
		Okies, now lets add those to our event!
		<div class="example">
			:: DildoScene-1 [nobr]<br><br>You are walking along the road while you notice some weird object on the concrete sidewalk.<br><br>@@.mono;Interesting, what is it?@@<p>&lt;&lt;link "Take a look at it."&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;go "DildoScene-1-Look"&gt;&gt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;<p>&lt;&lt;link "Just ignore it."&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;go "DildoScene-1-Away"&gt;&gt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;<br><br><br>

			:: DildoScene-1-Look [nobr]<br><br>You approach the thing and take a better look. It is about 12 inches long and flesh colored.<br><br>@@.mono;Wow it seems somebody lost their dildo, ha-ha!@@<br><br>You take it in your hand to inspect it and hear some voice from behind.<br><br>@@.npc;Hey, did you find it? Thank god!@@<br><br>You turn around and see a woman in her 20 running to you.<br><br>@@.pc;Oh it is yours?@@<br><br>@@.npc;Yeah, I was really worried I lost Arnold! I can't get asleep without it since I am 16!.<p>
			&lt;&lt;dialogchoice&gt;&gt;<br>
			&lt;&lt;dbutt "Return"&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;go "DildoScene-1-Return"&gt;&gt;<br>
			&lt;&lt;dtext "awkward"&gt;&gt;Give the dildo back to the girl<br>
			&lt;&lt;dbutt "Steal"&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;go "DildoScene-1-Steal"&gt;&gt;<br>
			&lt;&lt;dtext "greed"&gt;&gt;Try to run away with it!<br>
			&lt;&lt;/dialogchoice&gt;&gt;<br>
			<br><br>

			:: DildoScene-1-Away [nobr]<br><br>You ignore the object and go away.
			<p>&lt;&lt;link "Continue your day."&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;sceneclose&gt;&gt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;<br><br><br>

			:: DildoScene-1-Steal [nobr]<br><br>@@.pc;No way, It is mine now!@@<br><br>You run from the shocked girl with rubber dick in your hand shaking it triumphantly.
			<p>&lt;&lt;link "You got the dildo!"&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;sceneclose&gt;&gt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;<br><br><br>

			:: DildoScene-1-Return [nobr]<br><br>@@.pc;Oh, then here, take it!@@<br><br>You handle the dildo back to the girl and she looks really happy.<br><br>@@.npc;Oh, thank you very much! Oh Arnold, now lie still in the purse, Mommy will wash you and take good care of you, poor boy! Mommy will warm you up in Mommy's secret places in the evening...@@<br><br>With rised eyebrows you see the girl going away still talking to her dildo.
			<p>&lt;&lt;link "Continue your day."&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;sceneclose&gt;&gt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;
		</div>
		Almost done! Basically it is ready to be used in the game but there are a lot of thingies we also can use.
		<h3>"Has" macro</h3>
		Let's talk about &lt;&lt;has&gt;&gt; macro which is a very important instrument.
		<div class="example">
			&lt;&lt;has bitch&gt;&gt;@@.pc;You know what? Stick this in your asshole first, dumbass!@@<p>&lt;&lt;orhas slut&gt;&gt;@@.pc;Oh yiss! I wan't it sooo bad! Put it in me!@@<p>&lt;&lt;or&gt;&gt;@@pc;Oh, okay, if you really want it...@@<p>&lt;&lt;/has&gt;&gt;
		</div>
		With it we can check various PC kinks, traits, and mutations, here goes the list:
		<div class="example">
			KINKS: "risky", "pregnancy", "sizequeen", "cumSlut", "sub", "exhibition", "masochist", "buttSlut", "publix", "slut", "superSlut", "hyperSlut", "oral", "anal", "force", "rape", "liberate", "easy", "nips", "dom", "water", "bond", "hard", "fap", "shame"<p>
			MUTATIONS: "milk", "acid", "birthCon", "multiple", "gestate", "cycle", "twinWomb", "period", "immune", "mouth", "contort", "cumpire", "pseudoPreg", "elastic", "litePhero", "fertStorm", "goddess", "pheromone"<p>
			OTHER: "intro", "extro", "op", "cl" (last two are open and closed personalities)<p>
			TRAITS: "caring", "bitch", "maternal", "romantic", "deceptive", "devious", "persuasive", "perceptive", "forgetful", "forgiving", "lowEsteem", "picky", "crude", "friendly", "approachable", "relaxed", "flirty", "materialist"<p>AND TRAITS OPPOSITES: "uncaring", "kind", "hatesKids", "aromantic", "honest", "straightForward", "follower", "oblivious", "goodMemory", "vengeful", "narcissist", "lowStandards", "refined", "unfriendly", "unapproachable", "ambitious", "shy", "hippy"<p>
		</div>
		Also you can check libido like &lt;&lt;has libido>3&gt;&gt; and will like &lt;&lt;has will>2&gt;&gt;. PC can't get above 5 so &lt;&lt;has will>5&gt;&gt; will never be sucessful check.<p>
		<h3>Macro for PC values</h3>
		Last thing you need to know before starting is adding some stuff to the PC values:
		<div class="example">
			&lt;&lt;happy 1&gt;&gt; (makes PC more happy) (the scale is from -10 to 10)<p>
			&lt;&lt;happy -1&gt;&gt; (makes PC less happy)<p>
			&lt;&lt;stress 10&gt;&gt; (makes PC more stressed) (the scale is from 0 to 100)<p>
			&lt;&lt;anger 1&gt;&gt; (0 10)
			&lt;&lt;addtime 1&gt;&gt; (adding any amount of time in minutes to the ingame clock)
		</div>
		There are tons of other thingies you can use like parser for words, checking the wardrobe, weather and stuff like this not covered by this guide. You can find it in additional documents in the folder or just ask Thaum or Besty in discord channel. If you don't know how to check for something or do something you can always just write it in ordinary english so we will replace it with actual macro and checks when we will implememnt your event to the game:
		<div class="example">
			&lt;&lt;if PC has athlethinc bra on&gt;&gt;<p>
			&lt;&lt;add X to the inventory&gt;&gt;<p>
			&lt;&lt;That fancy "texting" display you used in fem prologue&gt;&gt;<p>
		</div>

		Well, that is all, you are 100% ready. Go now and write some cool smut there! :D
