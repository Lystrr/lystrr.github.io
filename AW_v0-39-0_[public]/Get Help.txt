Having a problem? Help is available!

The game website contains troubleshooting information for the most common browser issues,
which you can find here: https://www.thaumx.com/troubleshooting

We're also glad to help on the AW Discord, whether it's a technical issue, or just
a question or suggestion about the game. We aren't always awake, but there's often
someone around that might be able to help. https://discord.gg/vDSK6r

We've also got a proper wiki page that's getting better and better. You can find that
at www.aw-wiki.com

We hope you enjoy the game!
