On the way you ask her how much she owes this person. An extremely sour look grows on her face. In a downtrodden tone she tell you, &quot;I needed a loan to get my business going. You know the drill, for stuff like rent and purchasing start up equipment and furniture.&quot;\n\nCarla pauses for a moment before excitedly continuing.  &quot;It’s not like my calculations were off, at least not in a way I could foresee. I could afford the repayments but I never accounted for the protection rackets and all the people who would want to muscle in on my operation. I ended up borrowing more to keep myself safe and mostly independent. Now I need to keep them happy because the longer this goes on the more interest I end up paying.&quot;\n\n&quot;So you want me to try and find a way to make them happier with you,&quot; you inquire. unsure if you should be upset by this.\n\nCarla grins, sounding more herself again, &quot;No, Celeste. You are going to play a game of pool and win a wager for me.&quot;\n\n&quot;What if I lose? I’m fairly good, but I’m not pro,&quot; you remind her.\n\n&quot;Well I'm sure you can work something out with them either way. They are awfully friendly people and you are an attractive girl. I'm sure you will //come// up with something mutually beneficial,&quot; Carla says with a small chuckle. &quot;Don’t worry about whether you win the game of pool too much. That isn’t what the wager is on.&quot;\n\n&quot;What is the wager then?&quot; you say while you pondering what could be ‘mutually beneficial’ and her broad wording.\n\nCarla gives you a predatory smile and with a gentle tug introduces you to the loan shark and several of his 'friends'. They could just be a general crew or even trained bodyguards. You really can’t tell but they look the type: a bunch of rough thugs in their late thirties or forties who leer at you and Carla while she talks.\n\nAfter the introductions and a short round of drinks you start to play doubles with Carla. You find yourself up against Lenny the Loan Shark and his boy, a scarred man with a dangerous look to him. During the match, Carla whispers that the ‘boy’ goes by the name Joe Cool and is Lenny’s personal enforcer. You aren’t that surprised he’d be the one busting knee caps after seeing what he looked like. \n\nListening to the conversation between Carla and Lenny, you come to learn she is starting to slowly eat into the capital of the loan but the bulk of her payments just cover the interest. The drinks continue flowing as Carla and the men flirt with you and you enjoy the attention. You tease them by flashing your cleavage, showing off your legs, and letting your dress ride up exposing your still damp panties. The match goes poorly and the men suggest that you make it best of three. You know that you are going to lose all three as Carla is surprisingly poor at pool and the men are all regulars.\n\nThe final match is drawing to a close and you are leant across the pool table about to take a shot with Carla right next to you. As you are lining up the shot, Carla pushes the dress up exposing your butt cheeks. You ignore her and carry on taking the shot when you gasp slightly. Carla has pushed your panties aside and slid a finger in your pussy. You give out a little moan and jerk as you take the shot and miss. You then find Lenny’s hand upon your shoulder keeping you leant across the table.\n\n&quot;Relax, babe,&quot; he says with a small grin on his face.\n\n[[You really should just relax and enjoy this|RPool3C2A]]\n[[Pull yourself free|RPool3C2B]]</div><div tiddler="Random DT4" tags="" created="201504272122" modifier="twee" twine-position="5610,3790">Your day seems like it is about to get a lot more interesting as you round the corner and spot a large group of what can only be gang members.

Good they followed instructions. &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;They notice you and look back with sideways glances but don't say anything or make a move.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\n\nYou guess their boss must have instructed them not to interact with you one way or the other; at least, for now.\n\n[[Get you your destination|$DTdest]]&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;They are coming towards you and you recognize the gang markings. These were the people you were supposed to meet with and this time there is no way to escape. The bikes soon surround you and amid the roar of revving engines a gang member gets off his bike, props it up, and steps towards you.\n&quot;Hey, you. My boss is expecting you so you had better come with us.&quot; With the number of gang members around you decide to comply with the request.\n\n&quot;Ok, how?&quot; you reply. \n\n&quot;Behind the bike, baby,&quot; the gang member states. You look confused but it all becomes clear when another gang members comes out with a long rope. Seeing the expression on your face the gang member speaks again. &quot;Yes baby, we intend to tie you up and drag you behind the bike. This is what happens to people who mess with the Cobra's! You going to continue messing with the Cobra's, baby?&quot; Guessing that the gang member is going to give you a second chance you tell the man no and that you will meet with their boss as you agreed.\n\nThe gang member looks you up and down &quot;Good call, baby. We don't know if you are bluffing or not, but continue playing with us and you’ll end up regretting it. Make the right choice, baby.&quot; With that he winks, gets on his bike and rides off with the rest of the gang who split up. \n\nYou better meet with this gang boss or keep a low profile.

Geoff knows the owner and after arriving you are ushered into a back office room.  Geoff is very nervous and clearly unsure about you. His first question is the obvious; who do you work for and how can you get Sarah back. This then is quickly fortified by adding that there is no advance fee and no more credits in the back pocket; three-hundred is all he has. Your interest in this is not the credits, so you ask him directly whether he has the capability to discreetly fix the Magnum. Geoff looks at you and draws his own conclusions. \n\n&quot;You are a criminal as well?&quot; he vehemently asks. \n\n&quot;Nah, I'm part of a freelance mercenary team. Corporate business,&quot; you reply. \n\nBefore Geoff can head down his indignant line of thinking you explain that you can get his daughter back and that you’ve dealt with a lot worse than the Delta Cartel, and if Geoff continues on the moral approach, his daughter will never come back. If the kidnappers have not accepted the three-hundred credits already then they never will. The best people to deal with criminals, are dodgy operators.\n\nGeoff seems to calm down but avoids the question of morality, instead becoming emotional.\n\n&quot;I was told to offer three-hundred credits as that is the value of a slave prostitute over five years,&quot; he chokes out between sobs. &quot;What I got back was that the Delta Cartel does not do deals. Please help her... I can get your ship fixed, I swear! I have a few trusted men who would do the job on their days off&quot; he pleads. \n\nYou nod and Geoff leaves the subject of his daughter moves on to the more comfortable topic of your ship. He tells you that a repair deal would cover time only; you would have to fund the parts though he could run it through a business account. You carry on chatting about general things and then after thirty minutes you tell Geoff you will be in touch. Geoff tells you that he hopes your team make the kidnappers suffer. As you walk away, you wonder what Geoff would have thought if he knew that the team was just you. He probably would have called you insane.\n\n[[Leave the cafe|Intel15.2]]</div><div tiddler="SC36" tags="" created="201512230838" modifier="twee" twine-position="7990,1270">//Fucking two men in a cleaning cupboard to ensure her bank transfer goes smoothly is bad enough for Celeste. Getting off on the humiliation just makes it the epitome of classiness.//\n\nYour ''Training'' has increased by 1% and your ''Submission'' has increased by 2%.</div><div tiddler="implants" tags="" created="201409232010" modifier="twee" twine-position="5190,10">&lt;h3&gt;Implant&lt;/h3&gt;\nImplants come in variety of forms but the most common are cybernetic, neural, data processing and communications augmentations.\n\n''Cybernetic Implants'' - Advanced prosthetics originally developed to replace limbs and organs of soldiers wounded in combat, accident victims, and people with genetic physical disabilities. As the technology matured, some people chose to undergo voluntary organ replacement. The most extreme of them would sometimes replace over ninety percent of their original body with cybernetics to gain competitive edge on the battlefield. These people are known as cybernetic organisms, or cyborgs, for short. Some were known to end up mentally unstable due to feelings of being trapped or isolated; the technology wasn’t perfect and couldn’t fully replicate the sensation of living human tissue.\n\n''Neural Implants'' - Devices that connected into the user’s brain stem in order to interface. They ranged from the relatively simple nerve signal interceptors to advanced memory augmentations, data processors, communications and full body regulators.\n\n//Signal interceptors// are capable of blocking pain and allowing the user to exceed muscular strength constraints at the risk of skeletal, connective, and soft tissue damage. The more advanced systems fully regulate the body’s autonomous cardiopulmonary systems, improve muscle control, and release chemicals to help the body deal with shock. Data processors can also temporarily speed up reaction and brain processing times, allowing the user to experience the world in a state that make the world seem like it is moving in slow motion; some refer to this as ‘bullet time’.\n\n//Communications implants// are long range communications devices that can be accessed through a sub-vocal interface connected directly to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Audio output is linked directly to the cochlea and the calls can be switched between vocal and synthesized sub-vocal modes for covert communications and added privacy. While the synthesizer approximates the user’s voice, most communications that utilize this feature usually come through somewhat emotionless and flat.\n\n''Genetic Enhancements'' - Like the neural implants, these range from the simpler and cheaper bone density and tissue mass growth accelerators, which are comparable to anabolic steroids. If one was willing to invest more there are subtler modifications that increase muscle endurance and conditioning; mental, auditory, visual acuity; and eye-hand coordination enhancements.\n\nOne common factor with genetic modifications and implants was that the cheaper they came, the easier they were to detect. A musclebound freak or a cyborg using cheap, off-the-shelf parts was easy to spot by eye or a simple security scan. More advanced genetic augmentations, neural implants, and custom built prosthetics were harder to spot and often designed to fool any superficial scan.\n\n\n\nCeleste has body regulating neural implants and communications implants that allow her to access most local voice data networks. She also has genetic modifications to increase her overall strength, muscle endurance, energy levels, bone density, oxygen regulation, and other areas that increase her athletic performance without adding bulk.\n\nThese modifications don’t make her superhuman and are geared more towards the high aerobic and anaerobic endurance requirements of infiltration work. Celeste’s modifications means she could probably outperform most unmodified athletes in any field not involving pure muscular strength.\n\n&lt;&lt;back&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Intel23.3" tags="" created="201705072232" modifier="twee" twine-position="5190,6170">You point one of your pistols at her, and she looks scared and starts begging for her life….\n\n&lt;img src=data/cw5.png&gt;\n\nYou try and get her to talk, but it is all gibberish.

The man enjoys the silence and adds &quot;so we can enjoy you without having to move you around much&quot; the finishing with a chuckle.\n\nBefore you can question what he means, one of his friends pulls a set of bars out and assembles them in a shape that resembles an H in the middle of the pool table. You’ve seen contraptions like this and aren’t surprised when a neck restraint is added to the middle of the shorter bar, along two wrist straps on each end, followed by ankle restraints added to the ends of the bottom bar. The chains used to attach them only look to be a couple of inches long so you won’t have a lot of wiggle room.\n\nYou stand there as your challenger slips his hand up your leg, lifting the dress up and playing with your pussy. You watch the device and feel a shake of anticipation go through you.\n\nOnce the men is done, the men help you strip of your clothing this time and then you are restrained with your ass up, your knees and elbows touching, while your face is buried in the table. The men waste no time climbing atop the table and having a go at both of your holes.

She looks at you in shock, back to the man, and just nods and drops her work pants to the floor. You feel someone’s hand grasp your hair from behind and pool your head up from the pool table. You are briefly greeted with the sight of the waitress’s spreading her legs on the other end of the table before she scoots forward and your face is dropped down between her legs.\n\n&quot;That is for making her give head, not in the job description&quot; one of the men says, laughing at his own joke. \n\nYou diligently lick at her pussy and suck on her clit like it was what you were made to do. The men hoot and holler around the table as the waitress soon wraps her legs around your back to force you in as snuggly as possible. She soon digs her nails into your head and tightens her thighs around your head as a small gush of liquid runs out of her and into your mouth. You swallow, your vision a bit fuzzy, as the men pull the waitress back off the table and on to her wobbly legs. \n\nYou stare at the darker green of the soaked pool table as you hear them thank the waitress for the show and tell her she might want to consider a different career.\n\nWhen they make their way back to the table, the man slides two fingers into your dripping slit and your body spasms slightly against the table. To your surprise, you feel the restraints around your arms and wrists go limp but you still hesitate to move. Finally, the collar is released from the restraints, but is left around your neck. He places his other hand on the back of the collar’s latch and pulls his fingers out of you.\n\n&quot;That’s all for today, actually. Me and my mate’s actually had a good stroke while watching you have fun with the waitress. We’re all spent, you see, but I had this crazy idea if we left you like this you might want more,&quot; he explains as he undoes the latch, but wraps his fingers underneath the collar to hold it in place. &quot;If you come in here and lose to me again, you’re going to end up wearing a collar like this one every single day and I’m going to turn you into my own little toy.&quot;\n\nYou feel the collar’s latch finally release and get pulled from your neck. You are helped off the table and into your clothes since you can only wobble about for the first few minutes you get up. You can’t stop thinking about what he said or what just happened as you finally finish zipping your boots. On the way out of the pool room, the man slaps your ass to get your attention.\n\n&quot;Think about what I said,&quot; he smugly gloats, then closes the door in your face.\n\n&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!! Holy. Shit. I’m SO SORRY!! I swear I’ll knock next time!&quot; she screams then runs from the doorway. All of the men burst into laughter at this but quickly get back to using you for their pleasure.\n\nYou start to drool into the fabric of the table as they continue to stuff and fuck you however they wish. You lose track of the amount of times you cum while being used like this until you suddenly hear the man tell his friends to stop; apparently, he wasn’t involved in the pile behind you. You’re surprised by this sudden change since none of them have cum in or on you yet. One of the men pulls their cock out of your ass and hops of the table to the right followed by a man pulling his cock from your pussy with an audible schlick. Your pussy quickly constricts to wrap around the last cock inside of it before his final friend slides back and out from out from over your calves and hops down. \n\n&quot;You know we’re lucky we didn’t bust the table,&quot; one of them jokes before running his finger along your pussy. \n\nThe man, clearly not impressed with the concern, brushes the comment off. To your surprise, you feel the restraints around your arms and wrists go limp but you still hesitate to move. Finally, the collar is released from the restraints, but left around your neck. You feel him run his fingers along the collar and he tugs at it to get you to lift your head before addressing you. \n\n&quot;Me and my mate’s will probably have a good stroke later thinking about all this. I had this crazy idea though, that if we left you like this, like you were missing something, say, the cum part of you craves, then you might come back for more,&quot; he explains as he undoes the latch, but wraps his fingers underneath the collar to hold it in place. &quot;If you come in here and lose to me again, you’re going to end up wearing a collar like this one every single day and I’m going to turn you into my own little toy.&quot;\n\nYou feel the collar’s latch finally release and get pulled from your neck. You are helped off the table and into your clothes since you can only wobble about for the first few minutes you get up. You can’t stop thinking about what he said or what just happened as you finally finish zipping your boots. On the way out of the pool room, the man slaps your ass to get your attention.\n\n&quot;Think about what I said,&quot; he smugly gloats, then closes the door in your face.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n\nYou keep to yourself and make your way out of Ruck’s before calling for a taxi to take you to your apartment. The entire ride back, you can’t stop thinking about what the  man said to you. You couldn’t actually be interested in something like that, could you? Either way, you have to be careful if you go back to Ruck’s any time soon.\n\n[[Arrive at your apartment|Apartment][$Days += 0.25]] &lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC71&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;&lt;set $Mental += 4&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;set $RP to 6&gt;&gt;\n</div><div tiddler="FM3.1A" tags="" created="201712172122" modifier="twee" twine-position="1270,6450">You ask them the question and the pair realize straight away that you are judging them.\n\n“Look Xena have produced some genetic advances that will be felt by humanity for decades to come, Xena are very close to vastly extending human lifespan’s with cloning technology.

Sarah comes over and presses her naked body into yours and kisses you full on the lips, when you respond she grips your shoulders. When she breaks off you slap her backside and tell her to lead on. Sarah walks off in front and heads to the bathroom and hands you a towel, before getting into the shower cubicle. While you are stripping off, she watches you intently while soaping her body in a teasing manner. \n\nWhen you join her in the shower Sarah kisses you again and says that she will wash you, turning you around. Sarah starts on your stomach and leaves you wondering whether she will go up or down, as the hands move upwards you expect them to tease your breasts, but instead she massages your upper back making you murmur in pleasure. It feels like bliss with the hot water, steam and the feel of those hands kneading your muscles. The hands move down your back until they land on your buttocks, giving them a firm squeeze. A singular fingernail trails back up your back until joined bu the other hand on your neck. Sarah then moves in front of you and pushes you gently back into the shower wall, she kneels down and starts to soap your feet, lifting them up to clean the soles. This is followed by your legs until she avoids your pussy and starts to circle your breasts. Sarah spends time on each one with both hands, massaging them, stoking them and playing with your nipples. With one final kiss she kneels down and plants her face in your pussy, for this you get the tongue lapping away at your wet slit. \n\nAlready aroused you push your pussy into her face and her hands reach behind your buttocks to further trap you there. Sarah is attentive and eager and it does not take long for you to shudder and let out a little orgasm. When finished Sarah stands up and looks at you with a mischievous smile. She quickly puts some soap in her hand and proceeds to lather your sensitive pussy, you groan slightly as her gentle hands keep the receding orgasm in the back of your mind.  You kiss Sarah, a gentle brush of the lips, thank her and step out of the shower, leaving her to finish up.\n\n[[Wait for Sarah to finish|MArms4.1B]]\n</div><div tiddler="MArms4.1B" tags="" created="201611061102" modifier="twee" twine-position="4210,430">You wait for Sarah to finish and stand before you wrapped in a towel before you go through your plan. You are going to the apartment block and using your comms implant and the Magnum computer systems you are going to override the access system and wait inside. Hopefully Maloney will be there, otherwise you will wait for him, or look for a clue of his whereabouts. You ask Sarah what weapons she has and Sarah drops the towel to get a number of items.\n\nSarah comes back with a bag with bondage items including a restraint and gag, and a powerful taser. There are a number of other items in there but you don’t pay a great deal of attention. You can work with what you have got.  Sarah dresses classy for the occasion, she says that Maloney’s flat is in a nice part of town and that classy girls will not be asked questions. You let her get ready and spruce up your makeup as well.\n\nWhen you are both ready you head off, Sarah staying visibly calm but you can she is excited, nervous or both. When you arrive at the location the concierge makes no comment and you head to the lifts. Access to the apartment does not take long when the system is overridden, you tell Sarah to hold back while you make your silent way inside. \n\nYou find Maloney at home, sat in an armchair being sucked off enthusiastically by a naked girl with her arms tied behind her back. Maloney is pushing her head so that she is deep throating him, with the ease the girl is doing it without gagging you suspect she is a purchased product. You wave Sarah over as Maloney is engrossed and look with amusement as the girl sees you but is unable to tell Maloney, her gargled sound only encourages him to start thrusting his hips at her mouth while he mutters something along the lines of ‘take it, bitch’. \n\nWhen he notices you and Sarah stood on either side of the armchair he pushes the girl of his cock and looks at you both.\n\n“Who let you bitches in? Smithy sending me more hookers to make me feel better?” He questions.\n\nYou don’t say anything and wait for the recognition to come into play, it does not take long with the combination of yours and Sarah’s serious look until the realisation that girls he kidnapped are in his apartment. \n\n“Master going all limp, Master not happy with me?” says the girl looking unhappy and trying to get some stiffness back in the cock.\n\nWhat does not help as you have brought the taser from behind the chair into view, his eyes widen as he sees it and he starts to beg, offering money, offering the girl as property.  You grab him by the hair and force him to lie on the floor, taser pressing into his naked flesh. You don’t have to tell Sarah who puts a knee onto his back and applies wrist restraints, locking Maloney’s arms behind him. \n\nMaloney continues to offer promises, saying don’t do anything rash, that he is a rich man and tells the girl that you are his new mistress. The girl looks at you and calls you Mistress, asking how she can serve, you tell her to whip you up a cocktail and off she goes, trying to do it with her arms restrained behind her back. While the girl is occupied you pull Maloney’s head back by the hair and Sarah goes for the gag and forces the ball in, she then deftly does the straps up and you let go of his head. You then sit down in the armchair he has just vacated and fire the taser into his butt cheek. Giving Maloney a few blasts for your amusement, you tell him that he is sold lots of women to those bastards where they have been tortured and broken into sex slaves and sold like cattle. The point ends with ‘us’ as well, you tell Maloney that tonight he is going to die with a further blast of the taser. \n\nSarah askes you how Maloney is going to die and you tell her that Maloney is going to fall off the balcony, a sex game gone wrong. Sarah laughs and heads over to the kitchen, she asks you whether she can castrate him before he goes over the edge. With that she finds a kitchen knife.\n\nYou wonder whether she could kill or torture someone in cold blood, and if doing so will be good, or bad for her mentally. \n\n[[Agree|MArms4.2]]\n\n[[Say no|MArms4.3]]\n</div><div tiddler="RPool3C1" tags="Stat_17" created="201512171903" modifier="twee" twine-position="4210,1130">Carla takes your hand and you walk over with her to meet this 'loan shark'. On the way you ask Carla how much she owes this person. An extremely sour look grows on her face. In a downtrodden tone she tell you, &quot;I needed a loan to get my business going. You know the drill, for stuff like rent and purchasing start up equipment and furniture.&quot;\n\nCarla pauses for a moment before excitedly continuing.  &quot;It’s not like my calculations were off, at least not in a way I could foresee. I could afford the repayments but I never accounted for the protection rackets and all the people who would want to muscle in on my operation. I ended up borrowing more to keep myself safe and mostly independent. Now I need to keep them happy because the longer this goes on the more interest I end up paying.&quot;\n\n&quot;So you want me to try and find a way to make them happier with you,&quot; you inquire. unsure if you should be upset by this.\n\nCarla grins, sounding more herself again, &quot;No, Celeste. You are going to play a game of pool and win a wager for me.&quot;\n\n&quot;What if I lose? I’m fairly good, but I’m not pro,&quot; you remind her.\n\n&quot;Well I'm sure you can work something out with them either way. They are awfully friendly people and you are an attractive girl. I'm sure you will //come// up with something mutually beneficial,&quot; Carla says with a small chuckle. &quot;Don’t worry about whether you win the game of pool too much. That isn’t what the wager is on.&quot;\n\n&quot;What is the wager then?&quot; you say while you pondering what could be ‘mutually beneficial’ and her broad wording.\n\nCarla gives you a predatory smile and with a gentle tug introduces you to the loan shark and several of his 'friends'. They could just be a general crew or even trained bodyguards. You really can’t tell but they look the type: a bunch of rough thugs in their late thirties or forties who leer at you and Carla while she talks.\n\nAfter the introductions and a short round of drinks you start to play doubles with Carla. You find yourself up against Lenny the Loan Shark and his boy, a scarred man with a dangerous look to him. During the match, Carla whispers that the ‘boy’ goes by the name Joe Cool and is Lenny’s personal enforcer. You aren’t that surprised he’d be the one busting knee caps after seeing what he looked like. \n\nListening to the conversation between Carla and Lenny, you come to learn she is starting to slowly eat into the capital of the loan but the bulk of her payments just cover the interest. The drinks continue flowing as Carla and the men flirt with you and you enjoy the attention. You tease them by flashing your cleavage, showing off your legs, and letting your dress ride up exposing your still damp panties. The match goes poorly and the men suggest that you make it best of three. You know that you are going to lose all three as Carla is surprisingly poor at pool and the men are all regulars.\n\nThe final match is drawing to a close and you are leant across the pool table about to take a shot with Carla right next to you. As you are lining up the shot, Carla pushes the dress up exposing your butt cheeks. You ignore her and carry on taking the shot when you gasp slightly. Carla has pushed your panties aside and slid a finger in your pussy. You give out a little moan and jerk as you take the shot and miss. You then find Lenny’s hand upon your shoulder keeping you leant across the table.\n\n&quot;Relax, babe,&quot; he says with a small grin on his face.\n\nCarla presses a second finger into your dripping snatch and starts fingering you with more vigor. Any plans to escape are gone from your mind and you find yourself face down on a pool table, finger fucked by your friend in front of strangers. You notice that Lenny has moved and someone is pulling your panties down just before you feel Carla’s fingers slide out and down, across your clit. Her fingers are soon replaced by a cock sliding into your wet hole. The slight shock makes you try to stand up but you are pinned against the pool table. Carla now sits by your side with a big grin across her face.\n\nBefore long you are back to leaning on the pool table as Lenny fucks you harder and harder. As he finally cums inside of you, you let out a load moan that was likely heard throughout most of the pool hall. As you start to come down from the pleasure, you notice by this time that there is a small crowd of onlookers and a mixture of shame and wanton lust fills you. As Lenny pulls out you know that another of his crew has positioned himself to take Lenny’s place and within seconds your cunt is filled again. The public fucking resumes and you orgasm loudly brining a cheer from the watchers.\n\nTime goes on and you are fucked by another two men over the pool table. When you remove yourself from the pool table you see that most of the spunk has either dripped onto your panties or is caked down the inside of your legs. You can’t wear your panties since they are flooded with cum, so you kick them off and walk off to the toilets with a trail of cum dripping from between your legs. As you walk off, the roars and cries of the crowd echo behind you and Lenny slaps your butt and invites you back if you ever want a good fuck.\n\nWhile you are in the toilets cleaning yourself up, Carla comes in and congratulates you and tells you that she won her wager. You ask how that’s possible and what the wager even was in the first place. Carla replies that the wager was whether or not she could train a girl into being a submissive fuck slut who gets off on public sex. With that she slaps your ass and said that you know you loved it as you feel a fresh wetness in your pussy. You are a little taken aback by everything that just happened.\n\nAfter you finish cleaning up, you say your goodbye to Carla and sneak out a side door to head home and reflect on your night.\n\n[[Return to your apartment|Apartment][$Days = $Days + 0.5]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC17&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Training = $Training + 1&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Mental = $Mental + 4&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $RP to 4&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Release History and Change Log" tags="" created="201507181113" modifier="twee" twine-position="10,150">&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;__Release History__&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;v0.1 - Concept Demo Released 28^^th^^ May 2015&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;v0.2 - Improved Concept Demo 04^^th^^ August 2015&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;v0.3 - Concept Demo Relaunch 16^^th^^ October 2015&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;v0.35 - Ported to Sugarcube 2 24^^th^^ December 2015&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;v0.4 - Content Update and Fixes 07^^th^^ February 2016&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;v0.45 - Belated Easter Update 04^^th^^ June 2016&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;v0.5 - Beta Release 09^^th^^ September 2016&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;v0.6 - New Content Release 1^^st^^ Jan 2017&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;v0.7 - New Content Release 7^^th^^ May 2017&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;v0.8 - New Content Release 30^^th^^Dec 2017&lt;/td&gt; \n&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;v0.85 - New Content Release 28^^th^^May 2018&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n//v1.0 - Full Release (Estimated Mid 2018)//\n\n__Change Log v0.85 (from version 0.8A)__\n1.

While a generally safe, the path there is a maze of alleys, large apartment blocks, warehouses, small shops, and light industrial units. Street violence is not uncommon and you are not surprised when two less than savory types start to following you through the alleyways. You have no doubt that they will attempt to mug you or worse. You travel light and the only thing of value you could lose would be your local debit card loaded with a few credits that you use for food, transport, and other general commodities. The worst case scenario in these situations is usually that offworlders often end up kidnapped and then ransomed, in your case to your insurance provider. \n\nThe easiest option would probably be to just run away. You know where you are going and will be a lot fitter than these street thugs. Evasion is your forte as well. You could also ambush and get the jump on them before they even realize what is going on. If you do, you’ll have to either execute or interrogate them afterwards. The last thing you could do is go about your business and call for a [[security drone]] to help you have a ‘chat’ with your new friends.\n\n[[Escape and evade them|Random DT1B]]\n[[Ambush them|Random DT1A]]\n[[Mind your own business and call in a security drone|Random DT1C]]</div><div tiddler="MV1.4" tags="" created="201612301325" modifier="twee" twine-position="850,4910">This is the first hurdle on this mission, you have very little information on how good the security team and if they are using high tech scanners they may spot the powder.

As all the other women turn up in respectable dresses, you turn up in your outfit that pushes the dress code sideways. You are known as well to the security team as the Shebo Hostess, and treated as a novelty celebrity. You are waved through with no search and one of the guys asks if you could put in a good word about him to the Shebo team.  \n\n[[Onwards to the party|MV2]] &lt;&lt;set $M4drugs to 2&gt;&gt;\n\n&lt;&lt;elseif $M4escort is &quot;a hooker&quot;&gt;&gt;What you decide to do, is offer the security team a bribe. You are early and most of the guests will be some time away. Your hired help needs to earn her way and you have a private word with the team leader and offer him the ‘girl’ for an hour. What you are offering is a high-class hooker that none of the guys can afford, once the surprise wears off you are told that you are now a VIP, and VIP’s go straight through security.\n\nYou then head and break the news to the hooker, that she thought she would start the night with a few cocktails and would possibly sleep with a couple of rich and potential future customers later in the night. Now the night is starting with a bang, a gang bang from the security team and you expect her performance to still be high class afterwards. The girl complains and says that this was not part of the deal, but something in your eyes tells her to shut up. You promise to sort her out with ‘off the books’ credits which cheers her up.\n\n[[Onwards to the party|MV2]] &lt;&lt;set $M4drugs to 2&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Well you think the only option is to have a ‘private word’ with the team leader, or dump the gear.

The wrestler manages to get a shot onyou and breaks the hold your legs had on him.\n\n&lt;img src=data/cage34.png&gt;\n\nYour struggle partially ends when he manages to pin your arms by your biceps.

At his insistence, you join him for a chat and a glass of your favourite brew on him. Shaun is seemingly getting more confident and tells you that Carla has been giving him some advice and he says he is getting even better. He insists that you helped open his mind up to what is going wrong and that he wants to thank you.\n\nShaun wants to treat you for a night out starting at the Ruck's Pool Bar on the condition you come dressed up for a night out. While looking at your jumpsuit he adds, you should show off your lovely legs, maybe with some heels.\n\nYou can tell by the glint in his eye and his eagerness that there is something more behind all of this. Based on your last encounter with Shaun and Carla you ask him whether she knows about this offer. Shaun looks a bit sheepish and tells you that it was Carla who gave him the idea and that she may join them later in the evening. Clearly after breaking his confidence, she is now rebuilding him as her soon to be obedient husband.\n\nYou wonder idly to yourself what the plan is: Carla must have one and Shaun is totally on board. You probe him for more information, but he won’t bite. He only tells you it will be at night. You tell him you won’t give him an answer here and now, but you will seriously consider it... &quot;If I have the time, of course,&quot; you added with a wink. Shaun smiles, trying clearly to cover his disappointment, but asks you to call him if you decide you would like to. He gives you a little kiss on the cheek and you head off on your way.\n\nIf you want to go on a date with Shaun and Carla at some point, then all you need to do is arrange it and turn up at the Ruck's Pool Bar.

Enjoy spreading your legs all the time.&quot;\n\nJudging by the noise, you are wheeled through what you think is an industrial complex. After twenty minutes bouncing around on the cart, or stationary in an elevator, it all comes to a halt. Many hands hold you down, undo the cart restraints, and then take the handcuffs off you. You are pulled off the cart and thrown onto a mattress.\n\n&quot;Remove the bag and gag, bitch,&quot; demands a stern, cruel voice. You do as you are bidden and pull the bag off.\n\nWhen your eyes adjust to the light, you pull the gag off and see a burly man holding a hose pipe. A sudden burst of water comes blasting out of it and crashes into you, sending you backwards. For the next few minutes you find yourself chased around a small cell as they concentrate on hosing your pussy.  Eventually they lose interest in their game and stop, leaving you freezing cold and dripping onto the metal floor.\n\nThe men walk out and close the cell door and one of them taunts you, &quot;Not sobbing yet, eh? Well, we have the whole night to fix that for ya.  With that the cell door is slammed shut and you are left naked in your sterile, barren cell, with just a mattress for company and a grate where the water is running out. You wonder if the grate is your toilet and feel sick. As footsteps echo down, the corridor the same voice shouts out, &quot;One more thing, you now have no name. You will now respond to number 25, slave number 25!&quot; before he finishes with a little cruel laugh. You silently promise yourself that by the time this over, you are going to carve the number 25 somewhere on his body; his ass, cock, forehead, or balls come out as your personal favorites and grant a slight brevity to your predicament.

Suddenly aware that he could be on camera the hands slide away and there is a pause when Mick digests that you allowed yourself to be intimately groped. \n\nEncouraged Mick tells you that every now and then security staff need to patrol the staff areas and points over at a side door.

You place your order followed by Selina, who orders the 'Dark Eclipse' blend along with both of her friends. The waitress smiles and nods before taking your menu and walking off. You continue to make idle banter with the girls about their classes and lives to pass the time.\n\nYou remember what it was like to be their age once; it all seems so trivial in comparison to your current predicament. You swear at one point you feel a foot brushing along your leg for a few lingering moments and look over each girl for any indication of who it could be, but to no avail.\n\nThe waitress returns with four cups of tea and two pots and sets them in their appropriate places upon the table. You continue your conversations as all of you begin to passively sip at your teacups. The High Dragon is certainly delicious, but has a surprisingly strong bite that makes you wonder what spices they used for it.\n\nOnce you are two cups in, your body starts to feel warm and you notice it's become slightly harder to follow the girls' conversations as you sip at your third.

You dwell on what is going to happen next and understand why Sarah is screaming; you are only the warm up event.\n\nAs the phallus is worked into your unwilling pussy, the breast rings are lowered until they are completely pressed against your flesh.

So, it’d be best if you just give into the training, knowing full well that deliberate disobedience will bring this. Oh, and since you two got so friendly, from now on we have assigned Number 33 to be your mentor,&quot; proclaims a guard.\n\nYou wonder briefly as you scan the room about who is a guard, who is a trainer, and which of these bastards is in charge, but you figure they probably alternate to keep slaves guessing. \n\n&lt;img src=data/dev5.png&gt;\n\n&quot;Do your worst,&quot; you say quietly enough to barely be heard.\n\n[[Time feels like it stops entirely|KG3.3]]</div><div tiddler="KG3.3" tags="" created="201605012322" modifier="twee" twine-position="1970,6030">They take your invitation with glee and do their worst once the trigger is pressed.

Sometimes they leave a few moments in between the blasts to address you along with the slaves in the room. Sarah Tranter is quiet and you expect that she has been gagged at this point.

You wonder what a sight you must both look; you just in your underwear with one leg in your jumpsuit and a voluptuous blonde in a thong... correction holding a thong... correction, you are ducking that thong being thrown at your head.\n\nYour slight movement means the thong hits you on the shoulder instead of the face, like she had intended. You reach for it and find it damp. Carla smiles and her hand moves to her crotch.\n\n&quot;You are a quick bitch,&quot; Carla says with hunger in her voice as you note a gleam in her eye.\n\nYou can't help feeling aroused yourself by the sheer oddness of the situation. You were caught about to cheat with her boyfriend and now the girl wants to have you as well and is clearly aroused. She is a hot one as well and clearly very kinky.\n\n&quot;Fuck it...&quot; you think to yourself.\n\nYou kick your foot out of the jumpsuit and step towards Carla. You grab her shoulders and pull her close and kiss her passionately on the lips. Carla returns the kiss and reaches down to your panties and tugs them down. Within minutes you find yourself in the 69 position on Shaun's sofa with Carla's tongue greedily tasting your pussy. You return the favour as best you can and lick her clit and finger her vigorously. You continue pleasuring each other until you reach a spasming climax.\n\nOnce you come down from the excitement of what has happened, you find yourself at the end of the sofa with Carla's outstretched foot rubbing your pussy.\n\n&quot;That was great, darling, but we have to deal with Shaun now.

A slap to the face of executive management when they look at bonuses for the year, the show is not cheap to produce and winners are not always budgeted for.

This whole thing is a lot different from the high quality intelligence that Sid would normally provide you with, it is rare that you have to use the Magnum’s computing power via your comms link. Also in the corporate world the Magnum’s computers don’t go very far, but for some criminal gang’s security system it will do the job nicely. You just need to get a connection to the system and there are only two ways; going to the building or getting close to an access card, only the senior gang members will hold those.\n\nThe best option is for you to do the hands on search as dragon gang members enter the club, the whole place is considered a neutral zone for deals to be struck and the security stance is accepted by all sides, unlike the Dragon gang owned clubs where they will all be armed to the teeth.  The problem is you will need to be accepted on the VIP team and Aruba don’t have any connections to that team. Again you are going to have to rely on your feminine charm and the hope that most security staff don’t want the search duty, especially with egotistical and psychotic criminals. \n\nOn your first night at the club you arrive as part of agency staff to feel gaps in the regular crew. You wear the uniform of black trousers, boots and a white blouse. Your blouse is unbuttoned enough so a glimpse of bra and cleavage is showing.  For your first shift one of the team leaders takes you under his ‘wing’, unsurprisingly really as there is one other girl and you are better looking, the rest are blokes.  There is a lot of time to talk and he asks you what duty you would like, you say the search teams as you don’t like the loud music and have no interest in dealing with the fights. You will deal with the drunken VIP girls, but getting stuck in to the big fights is not what you want. Mick tells you that he can put in a good work and that it is right that a looker like you does not get her face damaged. For good measure Mick points to his nose which bears many scars of fights. \n\nA couple of times during the night you felt Mick’s elbows brush your tits, or knuckles slide past your thighs or butt but you are now stood on a balcony with no-one behind you and his hand is on your ass. \n\nWhat do you do?\n\n[[Ask him to remove it|CL1.6A]]\n[[Ignore it|CL1.6B]]\n</div><div tiddler="Reds1.1" tags="" created="201507181641" modifier="twee" twine-position="3090,1270">You get yourself a drink and head over to an empty cubicle.

Being somewhat bored you tell the man to take a seat.\n\nAs you chat you find out that his name is James and he works in the entertainment industry, specifically as a planner for the game show called ‘Run the Gauntlet’. He doesn’t want to delve too deeply into the subject as there were strict non-disclosure agreements in effect, but hints that the show will be coming to Evindium Prime next.\n\nYou had heard of the show but never bothered to watch it, you knew that it was banned on New Terra for its controversial content and that the show offered a fairly large sum of credits to the winner, but often resulted in death for the contestants who failed to make it to the end. The money wasn’t anything too special but could come in handy in your current situation.\n\nYou listen politely and even flirt with him as he appears genuinely interesting and is good company. When it was time for him to leave to meet his boss he gives you his card with his personal contact details and tells you that he will be staying on the planet for the next couple of months or so.\n\n[[Head back to your apartment|Apartment][$Days = $Days + 0.25]] &lt;&lt;set $Int3 to &quot;True&quot;&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;set $Reds to 2&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Intel11.1" tags="" created="201606031145" modifier="twee" twine-position="4910,4350">The taxi drops you off at the loading dock of a seemingly abandoned building.

You are obviously resourceful and we cannot pin you to any of the known players on the criminal side or to the corporations, unless they’re keeping you at arm’s length. I think you are a freelance. That or spearheading for a new player. Now I know that somewhere nearby you either have a hiding hole or regular meetings with someone. I want to know two things: Who do you work for and can you help us or do we any sorta common goal?&quot;\n\nYou give a slightly ambiguous story that you are working for an off planet organization and are essentially freelance on planet while you try to progress on some leads. It is true enough and you say that to support your mission, ‘muscle’ support will be needed and that it is quite possible that working together could lead to the Cobra’s advancement. The Cobras can evaluate the risk and reward themselves, you figure. You pause to catch your breath and look around at the faces surrounding you and a smirking girl catches your eye. You lock eyes momentarily before she begins to speak:\n\n&quot;Bitch, you’re talking shit. You sound like some corporate military jerk giving a briefing speech. I think you should just suck some Cobra cock if you want to be of any use. Maybe I would even let you lick me out if you’re like that and ask nicely,&quot; she offers smugly as others around her laugh. \n\nYou feel the atmosphere changing every passing second you don’t respond. The gang leader has said nothing and it is clear he wants to see how you handle things. After all, the gang has to respect you or at least see the benefits of alliance.\n&lt;&lt;if $Weapon5 is 1 and $Weapon4 is 1&gt;&gt;You are not going to take any shit from this bitch so you turn and face her. You don’t make any threatening gestures but slowly stride towards her with the katana scratching a line in the concrete.

You look her in the eyes and smile.\n\n&quot;I won’t kill you. I will just open your pussy up so you can take lots of Cobra cock, all at once,&quot; comes your cold response.\n\nWith a flick of your wrist, the blade cuts through her leather trousers, splitting them apart at the crotch and revealing her shaved, tattooed pussy.\n\nBefore you can take matters any further, the leader tells the bitch to shut up and enjoy the draft which gets a number of the bikers laughing. One even shouts out that she needs to keep her mouth shut and wrapped around a cock when important matters are being discussed.\n\n[[Discuss a plan with the boss|Intel11.2]]\n&lt;&lt;elseif $Weapon5 is 1&gt;&gt;You are not going to take any shit from this bitch so you turn and face her. You don’t make any threatening gestures but walk slowly towards her, letting your coat fall open revealing the pistols. These semi-automatic pistols will cut through the assembled Cobras quickly and you want to make your position clear. As you are walking over, you unholster one of the pistols and point it down.\n\nAs you are an arm’s length from the biker, she no longer looks so sure of herself, but carries on. &quot;If you kill me, then the others will end you too, real quick like,&quot; a nervous twang building as she retorts.\n\nYou look at her, bringing the pistol up, and push it into her mouth and stare her down.\n\n&quot;I won’t kill you, unless, do you want me too?&quot; you threateningly torment her and then continue. &quot;If you don’t want your head blown apart, why don’t you go suck some Cobra cock while you let the adults talk?&quot; Her entire body shakes and you wonder if she is about to piss herself. &quot;Do you understand?&quot; you ask with finality in your voice.\n\nThe biker girl nods and then a male biker by her side unzips his pants. You lower the gun from her mouth and take two steps back. She looks to you, to anyone, for support, but then kneels in front of the other biker and take his cock in her hands. You hear her mutter quietly to herself that if it wasn’t for your guns, before her mouth gets stuffed with the other biker’s cock.  You let the comment lie and give her an evil little smile and she begins sucking the cock in her mouth.\n\nBefore you take matters any further, the leader says that the bitch was shut up in the best way possible, which gets a number of the bikers laughing.\n\n[[Discuss a plan with the boss|Intel11.2]]\n&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You feel vulnerable and a little exposed here with no weapons.

Lina avoids you attempts with ease and it does not distract her at all.\n\nWhen she has finished tightly restrained your arms, she stands you up and takes you to a mirror.

Lina has tied the ropes so that your arms are tied tightly behind your back and the crotch rope causes you to stand slightly hunched over. Lina tells you to arch your back and test out the ropes which you do with some trepidation. As expected the pressure from crotch rope cuts deep into your folds and you really feel it on your pubic bone. \n\nYou wonder why Lina has left your legs free but your thoughts are interrupted when Lina tells you to kneel. You do as you are told and watch as Lina opens her dressing gown revealing her glistening bush. Lina walks towards you until her pussy is next to your mouth. &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Lounge1F&quot;)&gt;&gt; You have no clue how eager I’ve been to get you back for what you did to me.

round you figure that this is just a meeting, the bar looks normal and the clientele the greasers and low life’s you expected. You spot the woman, looking a lot different than her business attire in the space quarter, now she fits in with the bar low life’s. Looking like a whore you think to yourself, with bitter irony you think to yourself that she might look the whore, but you have played the part of one. \n\nAs you approach you see she is in a quiet corner, you reckon you could kill her unnoticed. The thought gives you a moment of satisfaction as what has been happening has been a setup, it has all started happening since going to Evindium Fantasy Wear.\n\n&quot;Hi Celeste, surprised you don’t want a drink, after all the salty stuff&quot; she blurts out, looking to taunt you.\n\n&quot;Explain what happened before I tire of your jokes&quot; you bluntly reply, at the end of your patience.\n\n&quot;Master hypnotised you, put some control lines on you, make you do some silly things&quot; she contritely replies enjoying your expression. &quot;Even controlled the day you would go out and do them, good kissing by the way, still you were a few hours late, I had a long wait, but the kiss made up for it&quot; she teases you again.\n\n&quot;Got backup&quot; you taunt making the threat very clear\n\n&quot;Master told me not to say anything, your Sid could not get anything out of one of Master’s agents, I only obey the Master. Master said you would be interested in the command line that makes you jump off a skyscraper, said it would restrain you&quot; she finishes, amused and playing the simpleton.\n\n&quot;Why tell me this, what do you gain from it, how do I know I have this ‘command line’?&quot; you ask, worried that these command lines and made you masturbate, kiss the woman and suck 9 cocks. Stepping off a roof, seems achievable?\n\n&quot;Master, wants to make you a deal, Master will make you a deal if you see him face to face. Master considers me expendable, but would be sad if I died&quot; she says with theatrical flair.\n\nYou spend some time quizzing the girl, it appears that the ‘Master’ is getting his kicks out of humiliating you for breaking into Fantasy Wear. In his words you are a ‘naughty girl’ that needs to be punished. To have a meeting with him you need to some things, voluntarily. You will be told these later after the girl has gone. In case they are not to your liking you guess, if you don’t go, then you to trust that you don’t trigger the ‘command line’ that gets you killed. A date in the future, a place or certain words, you are told it could be anything. The girl also tells you that working for the Master has been the best thing that has ever happened to her.\n\nThe problem is, she sounds convincing. From what you can tell she is very much the person she always was, she retains the knowledge and skills. Just now she is hopelessly devoted to the ‘Master’, and made really happy by pleasing the ‘Master’. Completely brainwashed, the military would love it. You now have some choices:\n\n[[Kill the girl|CBNG1.4]]\n[[Agree to the tasks|CBNG1.5]]\n</div><div tiddler="CBNG1.1" tags="" created="201701011940" modifier="twee" twine-position="2390,2110">You were sucking this guy off, but you can’t remember starting doing it or all the others, Maybe just carrying on will bring it all back, maybe you were doing it for a reason? Maybe you just had a memory lapse. You quickly head back to the guys cock, which was starting to flag.\n\n&quot;Thanks girl, I’ll buy you a drink if you come round to the bar, other lads will as well, you’re hot to look at and give great head&quot; mutters the appreciative man.\n\nIt does not take long and the guy starts to spurt in your mouth before pulling it out, adding to the mess over your face and jumpsuit. You start to clean yourself up using toilet tissue and the cheap mirror, wary of the holes and unsure if any more cocks will pop through. None do so but you hear a familiar voice, the woman who gave you the address card.\n\n&quot;Hey Celeste, well done on doing the 10, 10 BJ’s in a good time and you have earnt some bar credits, just got to tell you the rate at the Glory Bar is way less than what the prostitutes get, but come on round, I’m sure you have some questions&quot; she says in a happy voice.\n\nYou hear the sound of her footsteps moving away and now understand, you are in the service side of the ‘Glory Bar’, a bar backing onto to a set of glory hole toilets. Inspecting the toilet you spot a number of small cameras, more easily spotted by looking at the patches where cleaning has taken place.  You can guess what the bar is like, a load of greasers waiting for someone to use the toilets. You know the place though, most of the female glory girls are generally really pissed and wanting more alcohol, or depraved and kinky bitches up for a dare. Anyone who goes through with it can get the video, or get some beer vouchers which can be used at other venues. Clearly it could be embarrassing to ‘service’ the hole, and then enter the bar with the clients. \n\nThe problem for you is if you want to see this woman, you are going to have to go for it. Problem also is that you are dying for answers, trap or no trap you are going in.\n\n[[Enter the Glory Bar|CBNG1.3]] \n</div><div tiddler="Intel 24 Start" tags="" created="201705122149" modifier="twee" twine-position="4070,6730">No content\n\n&lt;&lt;back&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Random DT1E" tags="" created="201506282206" modifier="twee" twine-position="6310,3370">You pick up the knife and advance on the still conscious man.

Too polite, to formal and very tense.  You ask him to be blunt and to the point, and after hesitating he comes straight out with it. Xena and Lantis have a secret location on Evindium, a converted Lantis mine, Maddock wants you to infiltrate the location as soon as you can. \n\nWhile you struggle to digest the request, Maddock continues; his inside agent source was a leading scientist in the Evictor project. The scientist was worried about an implanted set of coding that would the Evictor to be controlled, this was built into the DNA and genetic structure and it did not matter you build the Evictors, it would be there. The scientist did not know the full details as she was not involved in that part of the programme. This coincided in some intelligence that Lantis and Xena were collaborating on something, a mining company and a biotechnology company usually don’t have much in common and Lantis openly criticised Xena for its alien fauna research carried out on Evindium. This was in tune with the other mining companies not wanting a problem in a Xena laboratory causing the planet to be quarantined. Expensive when you have invested in a large mining infrastructure.  The other more public aspect was Xena was openly experimenting on alien fauna, while this was accepted as being scientific Xena has had a long history in weaponizing bio-technology. Not public was that it was suspected that Xena had paid others to obtain bio-samples from quarantined worlds as well. \n\nFrom what Maddock has told you he clearly works for the Commonwealth Intelligence Directorate and you tell him this. Maddock agrees and the room goes silent as he gives you time to digest the information. Finally, the question comes out…\n\n&quot;Why me, why me for the infiltration, you must have skilled teams?&quot; you ask, genuinely puzzled.\n\n&quot;Bureaucracy&quot; finishes Maddock, &quot;By the time everyone has agreed on an intervention it will be too late, I suspect they will argue over an infiltration team or a military assault&quot; Maddock adds.\n\n&quot;You infiltrating in, will confirm it, my whole team and my reputation will support it, my fear is that whoever Sid passed the data to will come to the same conclusions and will act swiftly, my operation here was compromised and if Xena get a hint from what was stolen from them then they will shut the base down quick time&quot; continues Maddock. “By the time my side spring into action we could be way too late” Maddock says, sounding annoyed. \n\nYou get the logic and wonder idly if Sid will be calling any time soon, it is quite clear that Maddock cannot offer you any money, but Sid will. Lots of it. But if Maddock is right then the whole thing sounds really sinister and this is why a young Celeste joined the military? Or was it for excitement? The younger, more morally aligned Celeste is some way off. You come to a decision.\n\n&quot;Maddock, let me be ready to blast off from this planet and I’ll let you know, this is not a firm offer as it is me risking my life for you. But the key thing is I need the ship and Jane sorted to even have any hope of pulling it off, and to make an escape. You got to realise that if Xena and Lantis are together in something illegal they will try and kill everyone involved until the military arrive. I may need to split and hide in a desert cave until the military come in&quot;.\n\nMaddock nods; &quot;Although I would like you to do this mission now, for the benefit of the Commonwealth I have no authority, just a bad hunch. If the mission confirms our suspicions then it is highly likely you will receive a good payment, you know the drill, they will interrogate you first and I am going to have a lot of explaining to do. I’m probably going to lose my job over this anyway&quot;. \n\nYou spend the rest of the time discussing matters, in your final days in the military you worked quite closely with the spooks of the [[Commonwealth Intelligence Directorate]], Maddock quite clearly knows that. This mission could be a suicide run, but the military part of you is saying go for it, as does your curiosity. Is Maddock a loon, or are Xena and Lantis a threat to the Commonwealth? Do you care if the Commonwealth falls? The Commonwealth is considered by some of being a struggling legacy of old Earth government, or the last bastion of human goodwill in an uncaring corporate dystopia. \n\nYou say your goodbyes to Maddock with the whole thing weighing on your mind, a trip to see Jane is in order as you can’t speak to her over the network. Not with this information. \n\n[[Return to Apartment|Apartment]]\n&lt;&lt;set $Mis8 to &quot;True&quot;&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $MadH to 4&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Days to $Days + 0.5&gt;&gt;\n</div><div tiddler="CBA1C" tags="" created="201601311525" modifier="twee" twine-position="1970,2110">You’re still groggy from the bike ride but there is no way you are going to be gangbanged by a bunch of bikers and you slowly climb to your feet.

Having the smugglers in front of you would guarantee they can't shoot you in the back but you’re sure none of them have the scouting know-how you do.\n\nThere is also the risk that you could encounter the surviving mercs down in these tunnels and if the smugglers go first, chances are they will be gunned down.\n\n[[Tell the smugglers to hand over their guns|Smuggler 2A]]\n[[Take point and risk being betrayed|Smuggler 2B]]\n[[Stay at the back of the pack is the safest|Smuggler 2C]]</div><div tiddler="Smuggler 3" tags="" created="201410202004" modifier="twee" twine-position="2110,4210">Two hours later and you have all arrived safely back in the smuggler’s safe house. You are sat in the corner, still suited up in your armour, with your helmet as you listening to the conversations going on.\n\n&quot;So, Maddock... He says that the customs are going to crack down hard on smugglers due to some corporate espionage that went down, I didn't believe him, and now one of my men is dead and we lost a shipment,&quot; the smuggler’s leader starts up. \n\n&quot;Well blow me down,&quot; cuts in another of the men. &quot;Look at the news! The headlines are saying that a mech got loose and went on the rampage that took down an entire customs and mercenary support team before a Xena Corporation Security had to take care of it themselves! Planetary Customs are now carrying out an internal investigation as to what happened.&quot;\n\nThe smuggler then switches on the TV in the room so you can all listen to the report: the official line is that the mech was tampered with by the mercenaries and given illegal combat software prior to being deployed. The rationale was that the 'cowardly' mercenaries wanted a good firefight with the smugglers to justify their costs. The news is also claims that a senior Xena Corporation Executive's son was with the customs team during the experience and has been killed.\n\n[[Mull over this latest report|Smuggler 3.1]]</div><div tiddler="Smuggler 1" tags="" created="201601271634" modifier="twee" twine-position="850,4210">While getting ready you are able to work out that someone in Billy’s team has interfered with the mechs programming and uploaded a warzone program. This is strictly against Commonwealth law in that robotics can only be programmed with security based instructions. The Commonwealth did not want to risk rogue corporations amassing private mech armies. \n\nThey also don’t know that Mr. Grayson tells you your end customer is actually a shadowy group of 'freedom fighters' who wish to aid the smugglers without any direct involvement. They have provided you a few alterations for the mech’s coding. All you need is ten minutes alone with the deactivated mech and you would be set. The problem is the mech is in its storage crate and you have no good reason to get in there so you need to make up a damn good excuse in the next thirty minutes. You contemplate just what to say as you slip your armour on.\n\nYou are one of the first to get kitted in your armour and this catches Billy’s eye. He then decides that this would be a great time to introduce you to the rest of the team.\n\n&quot;Team, all of you will not know Celeste. She is a last minute sign on who is just desperate to get a few credits so she can leave the planet. As a matter of fact, this is just how desperate she really is,&quot; he says with a wicked grin. With that Billy starts a little video that shows you entering Neptune's's Bar. You know how this is going to end and decide to play it up to your advantage.\n\n&quot;Fuck you, Billy! I’m going to learn my recon route with the mech. You lot can fucking enjoy yourselves, you jerk offs.&quot; With that you turn around and head off to the mech’s storage container.

An enquiring digit pulls the gusset aside and slips in between your wet outer lips and inside of you.  The other hand leaves yours breasts and you lean back into the guard with your breasts still exposed to the carriage passengers. You find the front of your dress being pulled up exposing the fingers inside of you to everyone on board.\n\nThe hand pulling your dress up stops at your stomach and anyone watching can see your pussy being fingered by he guard. You are starting to pant and are super excited about the public display. You moan and writhe against his fingers as you feel your orgasm building. You soon shudder dramatically as your juices splash onto the train’s floor. As that happens, the guard withdraws his fingers and then wipes your juices on your cheek. He then steps back, smacks you on the ass, and saunters off into the next carriage.\n \nOrgasm over, you pull your dress down and cover up your breasts and look at the exit doors.

Carla gave you a good description of what the place looked like, but was very vague on its exact location in the Red Light District; just that it was near some club. It was, if you consider half a mile away to be nearby.\n\nCarla runs a discreet service that is by invite only. Her place is just a floor with a few rooms located above a number of shops. If it wasn't for the signs she described and the way the stairs have been kept so clean, it would pass for just another slum apartment in the Red Light District. Now that you are actually here, do you pay Carla a visit or just chicken out?\n\n[[Pay a visit|Carla1]]\n[[Maybe another day|Apartment]]\n\n</div><div tiddler="CBC" tags="" created="201505130659" modifier="twee" twine-position="1130,2110">You're asked if you want to a one night special as a call girl due to your fame in the RLD.\n\nLeads to a gangbang.</div><div tiddler="Smugglers Complete B" tags="" created="201504111930" modifier="twee" twine-position="3230,4210">You arrange to meet Mr. Grayson at the same bar you both met at last time. As you sit in the back of the taxi on the way there you begin to wonder what you actually have achieved. When you arrive, Mr. Grayson approaches you as you exit the taxi and offers you a hand to shake.\n\n&quot;I’m glad you kept clear of that mech, Celeste. I hear it got a little carried away during your mission,&quot; he says with a subtle hint of sarcasm. You hold his gaze while you finish shaking hands. \n\n&quot;Luckily I’ve been in enough firefights to know how to avoid a mechs gaze. I only have one question for you though: Who is Maddock?&quot; you ask bluntly. &quot;I want to know because the mech was supposed to be reprogrammed to shoot mercs, not customs and corporate civilians.&quot;\n\nMr. Grayson smiles and gestures for you to sit down. As you do so, he carries on and answers your question.\n\n&quot;Maddock is a freedom fighter and a talented computer hacker. He hates the corporations and wants the Federation to pay more attention to the inequality and tragedies that occur on this planet. I didn't know he was going to pull this stunt though. I really did believe he only wanted to garner good favour with the smugglers as they provide their services to him from time to time.\n\n&quot;The good news for you is that he left his 'digital' calling card in the mech's core, so the attention won't be focused solely on you. Maddock also said he may have some more work for you. To get your interest, Maddock left a line of code so that the computer system at Billy's Bar has just overwritten itself.&quot;\n\nMr. Grayson finishes as you digest the good news.\n\n&quot;So when customs go to Billy's, they won't find any video evidence? If so I'm really pleased with that as I don't think it exactly showed off my best side,&quot; you say glancing down at the table. &quot;Changing subject, I didn't think you would be the type to associate with freedom fighters, Mr. Grayson.&quot;\n\n&quot;It’s not my first choice,&quot; he says giving a bit of a canned response, &quot;but Maddock is just a small thorn in the side of the corporations. Their worst enemies will always be each other. Even so, Xena Corporation will be after him even more than ever now. This is good news for you though, as their Head of Security will now be after two people. \n\n&quot;Just so you know, I only use Maddock for his computer hacking capabilities. His skills are one of the reasons I know as much as I do,&quot; he finishes. Still figuring that Maddock had enough information to bring down Mr. Grayson you ask what would happen if Maddock was captured.\n\nThe reply is that Maddock and Mr. Grayson have never actually met and only contact each other through anonymous means. This ensures that the risk of either of them compromising the other is very limited.\n\nYou ask about the smugglers, telling Mr. Grayson that were all killed and you’re worried that Maddock will be upset with you. The last thing you would need right now is a skilled hacker that is working against you. He tells you that Maddock will be disappointed but that the smugglers on the ground are part of a much larger organization; losing men will hurt, but they will recover. The loss for Maddock will be balanced by making his war hit home in the Xena boardroom today.\n\nYou spend some more time talking to Mr. Grayson but know your time is up when Mr. Grayson stands up to leave.\n\n&quot;Anyhow, Celeste, I doubt our paths will cross again, although nothing is impossible,&quot; he says maintaining his cool demeanour. &quot;I wish you the best of luck.&quot;\n\nYou nod, shake hands and walk away as you’re left back on your own.\n\n[[Mission Debrief|Mission 2 Debrief]] &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Mis2 to &quot;Complete&quot;&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Days = $Days + 2&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Int4 to &quot;True&quot;&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Int10 to &quot;True&quot;&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="CBA" tags="" created="201505142241" modifier="twee" twine-position="990,2110">You approach the goth girl from the tattoo parlour who recognizes you straight away and gives you a tight smile.\n \n&quot;I saw you on the billboards, flaunting your flesh in lingerie and I thought to myself that, is this really the girl who wimped out of getting a tattoo?&quot; she taunts you playfully.\n\n&lt;img src=data/gothgirl2.png&gt;\n \nYou make eye contact and grin as you tell her, &quot;You know my employers probably wouldn’t think much of a tattoo.&quot; A complete lie, not that she needs to know.\n \n&quot;Nah. You are just some corporate goody two shoes,&quot; she says, seeing partially through your façade. &quot;I bet you’re too much of a wimp to even take a ride on my bike with me even once around the block.&quot;\n \nNo bike ride or tough girl act is going to scare you and the opportunity to ride on a bike is rather exhilarating. It is a pity you will be the one on the back holding on, but with someone as pretty as this goth girl, you have a feeling you won’t mind.\n\n&lt;img src=data/gothgirl3.png&gt;&lt;img src=data/gothgirl4.png&gt;\n\n&quot;And you’d lose that bet,&quot; you say with a smirk. &quot;Now where are your wheels at?&quot;\n\n&lt;img src=data/gothgirl1.png&gt;\n\nThe girl takes your hand and her face lights up as she smiles. You return her smile back as she brings you to a bike parked at the curb. It is a beautiful, sleek bike, style to look like a retro chopper, right down to a combustion engine that must be modified to run on a local fuel and is adorned with two seats.\n\nThe front appears to have extra cushioning and is adorned with plush, black leather that matches the bikes paint job. The rear seat, soon to be your seat, appears to be a hard composite material, shaped similar to a saddle with a rounded nub protruding from between where the legs would rest. \n \nYou notice the girl pass you a few lustful glances while you look her bike over but breaks into a sweet smile when you turn back and she leads you over to it.  You are still not sure how comfortable you are going to be riding on that thing, but you did agree, and promptly straddle the rear seat.\n\n[[Time to go for a ride|CBA1]]</div><div tiddler="CarlaWager2A" tags="" created="201801011944" modifier="twee" twine-position="4070,710">You walk over to Carla and carefully undo the restraints on her wrists and ankles before helping her sit up.\n\n&quot;Damn, Celeste,&quot; she bemoans as she rests on her sore ass at the edge of the table. &quot;I really didn't know you quite had that in you. Now,&quot; she says while parting her legs, revealing her wetness, &quot;I was //really// close and I'd appreciate it if you'd be a doll and return the favor by finishing me with that cute mouth of yours.&quot;\n\nNot one to refuse such an opportunity, you kneel in front of Carla and your tongue begins to trace her thighs, her nectar collecting on your tongue. You continue running it around her vulva, your saliva mixing with her juices, as you contemplate how you ended up like this when it started as your prize. You finally tighten your tongue and begin to lap between her lips, stopping to swirl around her clit each time you reach the top. She responds to your shifted focus by crossing her legs over your back and locking you into place.\n\n&quot;Oh, fuck! Keep that up, Celeste!&quot; she moans as you begin to pick up your pace.\n\nSoon Carla's legs shake as her heels dig into your back and you eat her through an intense orgasm. When the orgasm starts to subside, she pats your head lovingly and releases you from her grip.\n\n&quot;Thank you, dear,&quot; she offers in a nurturing manner as you both start to get up. &quot;Get me my clothes and let's get this place cleaned up.&quot;\n\nWithin minutes she is dressed and the two of you have her office back in pristine shape. You noticed Carla never bothered to take her plug out and you aren't sure if that was intentional or she was just in a hurry. Once you both are finished, you decide to take your leave for the day.\n\n[[Return to the Hub|Apartment]] &lt;&lt;set $Days += 0.5&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Gangs" tags="" created="201508220926" modifier="twee" twine-position="7570,10">&lt;h3&gt;Gangs and Crime&lt;/h3&gt;\nEvindium has a number of criminal organizations which are tolerated by the Corporations on the basis that crime, like rodents, are hard to stamp out. The key players are:\n\n''Dragon Gang'' - Kidnapping, prostitution, slavery, gambling, and drug production are their main avenues. The forced immigration of people of Asian descent to the planet to provide low pay corporate support jobs had this secondary affect. The imported families had close ties and harbored a strong criminal network. \n\nStarting out as a basic street gang, corporate access allowed them to progress at bigger crimes, their favourite being kidnapping for ransom or slavery.  The Dragon Gang tends to keep a low profile but is giving the Delta Cartel a hard time in an attempt to gain supremacy.\n\n''Delta Cartel'' - The largest and oldest criminal gang on Evindium. Traditional in its outlook, they deal in protection rackets, gambling, prostitution, and local drug production. They have a record for supplying the corporation execs with contraband, including highly trained sex slaves (mainly kidnapped women). The Delta Cartel is mainly centered in the Red Light District and operates as a semi-legal organization; not that the small businesses who pay protection fees would agree. The Delta Corporation is currently trying to maintain a hold on the Red Light District with steady encroachment from the Dragon Gang.\n\n''Aruba Syndicate'' – A newcomer to the scene which gained a quick stranglehold on the import and export markets. Their smuggling of goods is something the Planetary Government would not take kindly too. The Aruba Syndicate also owns several nightclubs which it maintains as operational bases. \n\nThe smuggling portions are run as independent operations in an almost ‘sleeper cell’ fashion to maintain their cover. Whilst the Aruba Syndicate has a stranglehold on planetary smuggling, it is under heavy pressure to retain this control due to its lack of 'muscle' compared to the other leading players.\n\nThere are also a number of street gangs who have limited power but run drug dealing and other street level work. Most of the drugs flow through the above three gangs but there is some local level protection. Corporations will persecute the street gangs, seeing them as dangerous rabble, and having a Commonwealth mandate not to turn a blind eye to drug use and violent armed street gangs hasn’t helped.\n\nThe gang situation is volatile and it is only a few steps away from outright war. Part of the reason the Planetary Government has been recruiting mercenaries is to make sure the gangs are aware that there could be some ‘unfortunate’ massacres if things aren’t kept in check.\n\n&lt;&lt;back&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Random RL2B1" tags="Stat_47" created="201505032215" modifier="twee" twine-position="6030,4490">The Security Officer is a little taken aback by the comment and stands up and then steps away. Nervous, he asks, &quot;Please provide me with your visa, Miss&quot; You hand over your visa documents and he scans the records and your level two status comes up.\n\n&quot;Guess we are at a bit of a stalemate then,&quot; the gaurd says, weighing up the situation. &quot;I’m curious about your motives. You could have easily had me sacked for groping you on the train, but instead you go and ask for a 'private chat', say you are sorry, give my ass a squeeze, and say you want to deal with this matter like adults.&quot;\n\nThe guard pauses for a second and give you a lecherous glance before he continues.\n\n&quot;I think you either want this dealt with quietly or get a kick out of being a cock tease,&quot; he says with a smirk. &quot;So what I am going to do is offer you two options: I can either arrest you and you’ll have to pay the fine which may lead to me being sacked or you can deal with me like an adult and suck me off and we will be even. So, which do you choose?&quot;\n\nYou look up at him while you consider your options; he could call your bluff.\n\nWhile you are thinking, the guard quips in with another remark, &quot;You know how embarrassing it is to say you got beat up on a train by a chick?&quot; You knew making 'amends' would be interesting and you are oddly turned on by this situation. You don't want the trouble of making the matter formal so the decision is made for you.\n\n&quot;Deal. I want this matter forgotten about afterwards though,&quot; you state clearly.\n\nThe smiling security officer nods and unzips his pants revealing an already stiffening member. You step in front of the guard and get down on your knees. You reach out and play with his cock before opening your mouth and teasing the tip. When the security officer is fully hard, you take him in your mouth and set into a rhythm and play with his balls with your free hands. The security officer places one hand on your head and the other holds his phone as he films your head bobbing backwards and forwards. As you look up with a questioning gaze, the guard answers your unspoken question. \n\n&quot;It is so I can show the lads that I came out on top.  Getting beaten up by a chick has made me the laughing stock of the security office,&quot; he says before forcing himself into your throat.\n\nYou feel like a right slut and tell yourself that you are doing this for Jane. You realize the shame seems to be turning you on, too. Within minutes he comes in your mouth and you quickly spit the mess on the floor. As the security officer is putting his penis away and basking in the aftermath of his orgasm, you find some tissues and clean your mouth up then wipe the floor. As you are squatting on the floor the security officer looks at you and smiles. &quot;That was amazing. The guys will be so impressed. We are now 'even', but feel free to pop by again,&quot; he says with a final disgusting smirk.\n\nYou don't say anything as the security officer lets you out of the rest area and your thoughts begin to wander. Did you just get a kick out of being used and abused or was it a way to a means? You have never done anything like this before.\n\nYou’ve certainly sucked a man off before, but only the ones you fancied, not cornered by some pervert like this guy. A man who abused his power, no less. You feel an increasing pang of regret for not having snapped his neck post-orgasm.\n\n[[Get to your destination|$RLdest]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC47&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;&lt;set $RLR to 5&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;set $Training = $Training + 0.5&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Neptune's BJ" tags="Stat_6" created="201511192136" modifier="twee" twine-position="290,4210">&quot;Ok.

You feel a tingling from between your legs... Are you getting off on this? In a flustered state you walk behind the bar where Billy has begun unzipping his flies.\n\n&quot;Geez. Must be my lucky day today,&quot; says Billy, excitement written all over his face.\n\nYou find yourself kneeing in front of him with your hands reaching towards his rapidly hardening cock. You play with it until it is fully erect then slowly take it inside your mouth.\n\nBilly reaches out and places his hands on the back of your head but stays still and lets you enthusiastically fellate him. It does not take long before he starts to groan, one hand leaving your head to steady himself on the bar while the other hand tightly grips of your hair. As Billy starts to cum he forces his cock into your throat and shouts &quot;Take it bitch!&quot;\n\nYou could pull your head away, but he would cum all over your face and clothes, so you take it down your throat and swallow the lot just as you were directed. As Billy pulls out of your mouth you feel unsure of yourself. It felt like a twisted dream. Did you just do this and even enjoy it?\n\nBilly has a big smile all over his face as he looks down at you, slightly dumbfounded about what just happened.\n\n&quot;So, have you made a decision on whether to take me on or not?&quot; you ask, knowing the decision has been made. You armour meets his contract terms and Billy will be hoping he might be in for a shag later.\n\n&quot;Against my better judgement, I'm sure I can take your word and wait for your credentials to come through.

After the details have been sorted Billy speaks up. \n\n&quot;Don't want to know the full mission details before you sign up?&quot; he asks a bit confused. \n\n&quot;I've heard you have a reputation that most of your missions end up with your party coming under heavy fire at some point,&quot; you answer with a wink. Billy doesn't seem to know whether to look hurt or smug.\n\n&quot;You are right. The main part of this mission is to make sure the other side doesn’t get away, and you will be my eyes and ears for this. Just don't take your clothes off, at least during the mission!&quot; Billy laughs to himself.\n\nYou chat for a bit and then make your excuses and get your suit back on, noting that Billy takes great delight in watching you bend over to pull the leggings up. \n\n//Such a sleeze...//\n\n[[Time to prepare for your mission|Smuggler]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC6&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Training = $Training + 2&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Mental = $Mental + 2&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Nick0C" tags="" created="201508212328" modifier="twee" twine-position="1970,1970">Returning to the scene of the crime, you decide that you will try on the lace teddy again. \n\nAs you don the outfit, you feel sexy, you feel randy, and tonight you are definitely going to try on more clothes; tonight you are going to make men and women stop in their tracks and look at the video feed!\n\n[[Take it further this time|Nick0B]]</div><div tiddler="Intelligence" tags="" created="201504072114" modifier="twee" twine-position="10,570">&lt;h2&gt;Intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;Intelligence and leads can be found through conversations and general exploration.

You start to contemplate whether she might even just end up leaving you like this all night.  The brief wave of panic you feel at these thoughts soon turns to arousal and you're constantly reminded of this fact by the rope that is snugly grinding between your sensitive lower lips. You consider rocking against the ropes in order to generate just enough friction to get you off when the door creeks open.\n\n&quot;Mistress?&quot; you call out and receives no response. &quot;Is someone there?&quot;\n\nMinutes pass and you start to think your mind is playing tricks on you. You let out a sigh and are just about to relax yourself when something slips smoothly between the sopping ropes. The object penetrates straight into the depths of your pussy and stops once it pops snuggly into place against the ropes.\n\n&quot;Oooh! Mmmm,&quot; you moan at the unexpected penetration. \n\nThe object suddenly starts vibrating intensely and you start to jerk against the ropes. Normally it would have slid out of you by now but it is caught against the same ropes that are keeping you in place. You hear the creak of the door again and realize that you're going to be left like this for a decent amount of time. Rather than fight against it, you simply accept the gift of pleasure your Mistress has decided to grant you and focus your heightened senses entirely on the device that is about to make you cum your mind into oblivion.\n\nYour moans fill the room, likely along with the rest of the dungeon, while you float in bliss. Eventually, the door cracks open again, but you're too drunk on your now countless climaxes to notice. You don't have a clue as to what is going on until the vibrator that has been your world for the past hour is yanked out of your needy cunt with a gasp. Your body decides to commemorate this occasion by doing its best impression of a dam getting unplugged and squirting a torrent of your juices all over the ground.\n\n&quot;Enjoy your time in the clouds?&quot; come the comfort of your Mistress's voice to your ears once more. You nod, unable to muster the ability to speak. &quot;I'm glad, my pet. Now try and relax as we lower you down and get you untied.

I'm going to remove the hood now though so close your eyes.&quot;\n\nYou do as your told and the exposure to the dim light in the room feels intense, even through your closed eyelids. You take your time allowing your eyes to adjust while you're slowly lowered to the floor. Much more quickly than when you were first tied up, you are free from your restraints and helped to your feet. The receptionist brings you're your clothes and your Mistress supports your bod while she dresses you.\n\nYou spend some time in your Mistress's office drinking water and getting your bearings before you feel ready to call it an evening and go to the metro.\n\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC41&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;&lt;set $Mental = $Mental + 2&gt;&gt;  \n&lt;&lt;set $CPTimer to $Days + 3&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $SubTrg +=1&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Lounge1" tags="" created="201505122206" modifier="twee" twine-position="570,1270">You arrive at the lounge and immediately notice the formal wear everyone is dressed in.

You see how a respectful looking couple is turned away at the entrance and decide to talk to the maître d’ to try and figure out what is going on.\n\n&quot;Excuse me, sir. I just arrived on the planet and The Lounge came highly recommended as one of the top attractions. I was wondering if you could tell me what the entry requirements are for an establishment such as this,&quot; you inquire in a matter-of-fact tone.\n\n&quot;Certainly, madam. In order to be allowed inside, one needs to have acquired a membership, be accompanied by a member, or have your name on the guest list.

What a pleasant surprise seeing you here!&quot;\n\nYou turn around and spot a man dressed in an elegant suit with a silk scarf and large designer sunglasses. You recognize him from your time at the Shebo Showhouse, but his name escapes you for the moment. He was one of the men who watched with delight as you were restrained and suspended in the air. What a knob you think to yourself and smile sweetly at the man.\n\n&quot;It’s me, Giannio, your friendly neighbourhood fashion designer!&quot; he continues with a dramatic flair.\n\n&quot;Oh, you simply must join us at The Lounge but... Dear heavens, we can’t have you looking like that!&quot; He leans back with one arm crossed over his chest while rubbing his chin and giving you a scrutinizing look over.\n\n&quot;Hmmm, yes! You’ll do nicely! I have been looking for someone to show off my latest design!&quot; He reaches out to grab your hand and continues, &quot;Come darling. Let us go to my studio a few levels down and make you look fabulous!&quot; he says while already dragging you towards the elevator.\n\n[[Follow Giannio|Lounge1A]]\n&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You really need to find a sponsor.\n\n[[Leave the Lounge|Apartment]] &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Lounge2" tags="" created="201505122206" modifier="twee" twine-position="710,1270">&lt;&lt;if $Lounge2 is 2&gt;&gt;You turn up wearing a sexy pair of panties and a matching bra under your jumpsuit. Giannio’s personal assistant is standing around waiting for you with a pre-picked dress and mentions that Lina frequents Red’s Space Bar. You make a mental note of that and wonder if you should visit Red’s more often if there is a chance of seeing her again.\n\nYou change into the dress and enter the Lounge. You have good time socializing and at the end of the night get an invitation to a party which you gladly accept. You’re sure an affluent party such as that one will allow you to meet some important people.\n\n[[Head back to your apartment|Apartment][$Days = $Days + 0.25]] &lt;&lt;set $Int8 to &quot;True&quot;&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;set $Lounge to 3&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You go back to Giannio’s to get changed, this time making sure you are wearing the right kind of underwear.\n\nIts funny how the military lifestyle has accustomed you to the practical and comfortable but plain and unexciting underwear, so much so that it wearing them had become second nature to you. You consider getting out of the rut. Perhaps you should buy a nice pair of sports underwear or even something with lace to wear on more than just special occasions.\n\nAfter you get dressed, you spend the night at the Lounge. You do some socializing but the evening is mostly uneventful. Lots of people talk to you, some of whom you recognize from Shebo, and others are introduced to you by Giannio. You also get polite invites to cocktail parties and other events, but none of them are of any interest to you. You realize with this current scene you could go out every night and get nothing accomplished.\n\nStill, you had to admit that the night was good fun and if you kept plugging away at the Lounge you might eventually meet someone with the right connections.\n\n[[Head back to your apartment|Apartment][$Days = $Days + 0.25]] &lt;&lt;set $Lounge2 = $Lounge2 + 1&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="StoryAuthor" tags="" created="201409211326" modifier="twee" twine-position="710,150">&lt;div class='Caption2'&gt;&lt;&lt;popup &quot;Dracis3D&quot; &quot;Dracis3D&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</div><div tiddler="Foot Worship" tags="" created="201512121246" modifier="twee" twine-position="2250,710">After the 10 minutes are up you are collected by Carla for the next session.

Did being toyed with by my foot at Ruck's give you a bit of a fetish, Celeste?&quot; Carla asks with a laugh.\n\nYou flush from the memory and Carla's teasing. You definitely don't have a foot fetish yet but the small wet spot in your panties indicates that it may not be that far off.\n\n&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&quot;Since this is a basic foot worshipping session we will be using the red room today,&quot; Carla says as she stands up from her desk. You get up and follow her out of her office and into the hallway.\n\nWhen she opens the door to an adjacent room, you notice the entire room is draped in red velvet curtains and the ceiling is painted to match; it has certainly earned its namesake. Carla proceeds to a comfy looking upholstered armchair in the corner and sits down.\n\n&quot;Now strip down to your underwear and kneel in front of me, Celeste. I want you to help me undo my boot laces,&quot; Carla commands in a smooth tone.\n\nYou follow her directions and strip off your jumpsuit and boots and place them in an adjacent corner out of the way. You then kneel in front of Carla and begin to undo the laces from her boots. Once both sets of laces have been loosened, you gently slide each boot down until her feet pop free. Carla places her feet on your thighs and you set her boots to the side.\n\n&quot;Thank you for that, Celeste. Some people tend to try and force the boot off my feet which can be extremely uncomfortable. Now that my feet can finally breathe,&quot; she says as she wiggles her toes against your thighs, &quot;You may start your worship by massaging them.&quot;\n\nCarla raises a foot up to roughly your chest in height and you begin to massage it. You suddenly feel Carla's foot start to drop out of your hands and you give her an inquisitive glance as you catch it.\n\n&quot;What, you don't expect me to support my own feet during a massage, do you? Make sure to support me by my heel while your other hand works my arch and sole,&quot; she says sternly.\n\nYou're slightly taken aback by her statement but you //are// paying to submit to her, so the thought quickly passes. You adjust your hands as she suggested and begin to knead and massage her feet with your fingers. When you really press into the meat of her arches she begins to let out what you believe are light moans.\n\n&quot;Good girl, Celeste. Keep that up,&quot; she coos.\n\nYou continue your technique for a few minutes until you can tell the muscles in her foot have noticeably loosened up and switch to the opposite foot. You focus intently on relaxing her as much as you can. Once this has continued for a while she pulls her foot back slightly and holds it inches from your chin.\n\n&quot;It's about time you deserve a reward, Celeste. You may now worship my feet by sucking on my toes,&quot; she says with a subtle tone of glee.\n\n[[Carla presses the toes of her right foot against your lips|Foot Worship1]]</div><div tiddler="CL1A" tags="" created="201612311202" modifier="twee" twine-position="2250,3510">You find Benz sexually attractive in an arrogant way and tonight you have decided that you are going to use him.

This is about getting your satisfaction and you keep control as he tries to hammer you with his hips, to bounce you like his plaything. \n\nBenz does not achieve his aim of cumming first, you beat him, orgasming loudly and then milking his cock of its cum.

The story is that the ship was damaged when the rescue was made for Sarah, and that you are a mercenary team who gave a two finger salute to the gangs. You need to keep a low profile while the ship is fixed as the Delta Cartel will surely be back for revenge. The fact that the Cartel would likely kill the messenger that sold you out is not lost on the engineers working for Geoff.\n\nOn the monetary front, you ask Geoff to put the three-hundred credit reward towards fixing the ship but a total of four-thousand credits is required for the parts and a heavily discounted labor cost. It is a good price for the amount of work involved, you have to admit. \n\nGeoff tells you that it will take twenty days to get all the parts in and get them fitted. Jane will need to fly the ship in but he will put in place immediate onsite repairs to make sure the Magnum just about ok for atmospheric flight. This will this will ensure that the Magnum will pass through a casual inspection since nothing says &quot;inspect me closer&quot; than a ship with clear battle damage.\n\nGeoff will ask for two-thousand credits up front and the remainder can be paid just before completion.  He also asks that you need to meet up with Sarah as she is desperate to see you. He hopes that doing so will help with her rehabilitation.

Evindium being an example where the corporations have ‘regulated’ control. \n\n[[Speak to Maddock|MadH2.1]]\n\n&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;When you try to arrange a visit, you are told that the analysis of the storage drive is not complete yet and to come back once it’s done.\n\nIt was the &lt;&lt;$MaddockTimerStart&gt;&gt; day when Maddock started work and it is now day &lt;&lt;$Days&gt;&gt; since this mess started.\n\nMaddock should have it ready by the &lt;&lt;$MaddockTimer&gt;&gt; day\n\n&lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;NOTE: If the above does not work, click [[here|MadHskip]] to skip&gt;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;&lt;back&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n</div><div tiddler="MadH1" tags="" created="201510251523" modifier="twee" twine-position="570,2530">Following the completion of your mission for Maddock, you get a call arranging for another meet with him a second time. In the same way as before, you are picked up in a van and driven to the location, this time by someone other than Claire. The driver is one of Maddock’s other staff, a man you recognize but hasn’t been much of a talker. The journey is filled with silence but to your delight is shorter than the last time; clearly they trust you a bit more.\n\nYou arrive at the same place and are shown inside and taken down to a new room to meet Maddock. It is a small, bare concrete room which has enough space for an armchair and two-seater sofa. Maddock is sat in the armchair and rises to greet you.\n\n&quot;Nice to see you again Celeste. I wasn’t sure that you would be able to succeed. The information you got for us is proving quite useful to our cause,&quot; says Maddock with a genuine smile on his face.\n\n&quot;It wasn’t a problem. Things went easier than I thought they would,&quot; you reply with a neutral expression. Deep inside your thoughts are whirling as you nearly said it ‘went in easier’ instead. You wonder why your thoughts have been so sexual lately.\n\nMaddock then asks for a mission debrief and you go through the details, skirting over the more intimate ones, and are glad when Maddock does not pry. When you mention the video of Claire you came across, Maddock is visibly shocked and enraged, before his calm returns. Maddock then asks for more details and explains that Claire never told him about the incident; she reported she was beaten up. Maddock explains that Claire has been doing a lot of the investigation work on the data core you retrieved and grimaces when he wonders if Claire has been reviewing the video. Maddock quickly leaves the rooms and tells you he will be return shortly.\n\nMaddock returns and tells you he has sent someone to keep an eye on Claire and he will have a chat with her later. He also mentions that Claire seems to like you and it may do her some good to have a night out to recover. Maddock does not push the issue beyond that and moves on.\n\nMaddock once again thanks you for helping him and his cause and says he will now be glad to assist you with getting access to the planetary core systems. He makes it clear to you that he hardest part will still be finding a direct access point for him to work from. You consider what he has said and make to leave, but Maddock says there is one matter he wants to discuss with you.\n\n[[You wonder what he still needs you for|MadH1.1]]</div><div tiddler="Gang Kidnappings Start" tags="" created="201505101308" modifier="twee" twine-position="10,6030">&lt;h3&gt;Mission Prep&lt;/h3&gt;Before the mission starts, you sit down with Jane and consider who might be able to help if necessary.\n&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Current Allies&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;&lt;if $Maddock &gt;=1&gt;&gt;Maddock &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;N/A &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt; &lt;&lt;if $Maddock &gt;= 2&gt;&gt;Maddock has agreed to help you on this&lt;&lt;else &gt;&gt;Not a viable option &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;&lt;if $Lina &gt;= 1 and $Claire &gt;= 1&gt;&gt;Lina and Claire partnership &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;N/A &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;&lt;if $Lina &gt;= 2 and $Claire &gt;= 2&gt;&gt;Lina and Claire have agreed to work together to assist you &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Not a viable option&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;&lt;if $Max &gt;=1&gt;&gt;Max &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;N/A &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; &lt;/td&gt; \n&lt;td&gt;&lt;&lt;if $Max &gt;= 2&gt;&gt;You can arrange for Max’s Crew to rescue you &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Not a viable option &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;&lt;if $Weapon1 is 1&gt;&gt;You have the fingernail blades that will allow you to defend yourself if needed.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You are lacking a discrete weapon which will lower your odds of success.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\n\n[[Start the Mission|KG1]]\n[[Back out and in order to better prepare|Apartment]]</div><div tiddler="MRE2C3" tags="Stat_55" created="201602012141" modifier="twee" twine-position="1130,5750">You walk over to the Sub-Commander, knife in hand, and look down on him with disgust in your eyes.\n\n&quot;Not so easy there asshole,&quot; your voice comes out full of malice. &quot;I'm not done with you yet.&quot;\n\nA shocked expression clouds Drake’s face as you lean down and jab the knife back into his open wound and he shrieks in pain.\n\n&quot;That should slow the bleeding //just// long enough for me to get my payback,&quot; you chide with a sadistic grin on your face, &quot;but we really have to do something about that screaming of yours.&quot;\n\nYou suddenly come up with the perfect solution and walk over to your pile of clothing.

After that, it will be time to paint them.&quot;\n\nYou immediately start twisting the towel to release as much water as possible.

You did a good job but now it is time for the fun to begin,&quot; she leads on as she pulls her legs back to her chest and curls up in the chair. &quot;Scoot the footstool away and slide those panties off then you can grab the polish,&quot; she orders as she openly peeks between your thighs as you start to pull them down.

Mick avoids the subject by saying if you did have any problems with male customers then Mick and the boys would step in to help you. With that he slips an arm around your waist as a comforting hug, but then leaves it gently in place.

Mick says he will stay close in case you need help, just call him on the radio system.\n\nMick heads off and you are left to the half-filled bar area.

When you turn round they walk off and you decide to ignore it. But a couple of minutes after another one pinches your ass cheeks. This time you are prepared for it and grab his arm, the bloke struggles half-heartedly treating it as a game.  Club rules are that you can throw him out but violence is frowned upon due to the customer base. Only if customers are violent can it be returned, one of the guys mates also joins in by stepping behind you and grabbing your tits in both hands. You break free from the grasp and push the two of them to the floor. Other males get in the way and a scene develops, just as you think you may be fighting Mick arrive with another bouncer and disperse the crowd. The two guys who groped you are long gone, along with their mates. Mick speaks to the bar staff and then asks for a quiet word in the staff area, Mick takes you a store room with no-one in it and tells you that the bar staff said you led a load of blokes on, who then touched you up.

The rest of the time drying passes more civilly and you are more grateful than ever to be in tip-top physical condition in addition to your implants. \n\nWhen you right yourself and get back on your knees, Carla sits perched on the edge of her seat but doesn't look near as frustrated as after your previous success.\n\n&quot;I'm impressed, Celeste,&quot; she says, her tone sincere as she addresses you directly. &quot;Not many people can hold out that well and the top coat is a quick drying finish; if I had to guess, a two-minute dry at most.

No more shots ring out\n\n&quot;Very brave Trisha, but very stupid, you can’t escape and I’m not coming out into the corridor, come back and surrender&quot; says the man in a calm manner. &quot;You are good Trisha and once we get all the information out of your pretty head we might let you work for us, after we kill Michael Benz of course&quot;.\n\nYou think about it and decide you have no choice but to surrender. You can’t get out of the basement, you had a good look at the door. There is no way you could kick your way out, or using any of the tools down here.  With a grimace you reply that you are surrendering and tell him not to shoot. As you walk to the doorway you put your hands on your head and then stand in the doorway. The two standing men look at you for a second, admire your figure and look pleased with themselves. One man stuffs his gun down his pants and tells you to lean over a table in the middle of the room, the man you assume is the spymaster keeps the gun pointing at you. You do as you are bid and lie face first on the table, the gun is pressed into your temple and the other man cuffs your arms behind your back.

You try and say you are not Trisha but he does not believe that, and you can’t pretend that you are because you don’t know enough about Aruba. The worst part of it is that he has a photo of you attending the main Aruba location so he knows you have something to do with it. The problem is the spymaster knows something is not right and makes a decision.

This is one of your biggest concerns, while not many, or even any of the women will be trying to get it on with Paul. Paul could decide he is going to hang out with Helen, or some blokes. The problem being getting the quiet time….\n\nAs it happens your antics with Sarah Thornton and your Shebo reputation makes you a party hit. Paul even comes over and is very complimentary. &lt;&lt;if $M4outfit is 1&gt;&gt;Paul tells you that you are wearing the perfect dress, all the women would have called you the Shebo whore, and here you are in a dress that fits the description, with all the men talking about you, not them. You wonder how much Paul has to drink already.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Paul tells you that the dress is lovely, sexy but refined and Paul says he likes to wind the other girls up by saying at Shebo you are elegant and beautiful in the bondage gear. Like a portrait, he says and you wonder how much he has had to drink. &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Paul’s mates say that he has had a thing for you since you broke the record at Shebo and his last girlfriend got a little insecure about it. You find that amusing, as you know his last girlfriend quite well and Paul’s mates talk about that event where you embarrassed Sarah. That starts them off about things you could do to some of the stuck-up women at the party. \n\nPaul tells you that he is going to hang out with the blokes, but that suits you as the women either hate you or consider you a threat. Working with blokes for so long in the military you generally prefer their company to the girls that spend all the time with makeup, pampering, shopping and catty comments.\n\n[[Continue partying with the blokes|MV2.1]]\n</div><div tiddler="CL1.1B" tags="" created="201611222034" modifier="twee" twine-position="430,6730">You decide that you can talk your way out of this and if given an opportunity you can take them out, grab the guns and shoot your way out.

He understandably asks you why and you hold his gaze and say &quot;curiosity&quot;.\n\nNervously he nods and waves you forwards. You walk to the front of the alleyway while taking care that the man does not feel trapped. You stop, turn around, and lean against the wall. The man casts you a nervous glance and says, &quot;Go on.&quot;\n\nYou tell him that you are a mercenary and have a good eye for details. The other day you watched a certain commotion in the store. During that time, you saw a solid amateur raid go on in the background and were amused by the group’s audacity. The man looks startled and you quickly let him know you aren’t interested in the credit reward. The man turns and asks you what you really want then. You tell him that you might have some work for his crew. You noted they were a team of at least four if not five.\n\nAn angry glint appears in the man’s eyes, &quot;You think we are for sale? That we will just work for anyone? We are stuck on this planet because our employer let us down! We are now trying to survive... We don't want to act as thieves, but we steal to stay alive... to save up... and leave this place.&quot;\n\nOnce he finished, you calmly reply back, &quot;You don't know my story, but we share some similarities. If you can help me out, I can get you off of this planet. I want to leave as well.&quot;\n\nThe man looks at you for a few seconds &quot;Ok, well, I sort of trust you. We will need to talk more somewhere else.

The main core area would be opened by a cryptokey, not by your hacking system that is for sure, or probably by anyone in the facility. \n\nYou look around the room and come to a conclusion this room is a small command centre, to get to it you had to walk down a 200 metre tunnel, past several opened blast doors.  There is a single luxurious chair in the room and arrays of hologram projectors, there are two other doors in the chamber, a sealed door to the computer core, and another open to a small but luxurious apartment. \n\nThere are a couple of monitors displaying live feeds, but they don’t give much away, just telling you that all systems are operational, including a military grade comms system. \n\nYou take a closer look at a pedestal in front of the chair and notice a recess for a cryptokey. It looks like to get this place operational you would need a cryptokey.\n  \n&lt;&lt;if $XenaKey is 1&gt;&gt;Your heart starts beating a little bit faster, the Xena CEO had to be coming here, the cyrptokey he brought must be the one to activate this place.

The fights are centered on two key audiences: the betting community and the fight-fans. Both communities love mismatched battles for their sheer unpredictability.\n\nThe rules are decided before every match but they generally follow the standard rules for mixed martial arts which don’t allow more dangerous blows and attacks. These rules can be change during 'grudge matches' but aren’t overly common as the fight-fan community is generally disappointed when their favourite fighter has to leave early due to injury.\n\nJane tells you a debut fighter is in a very good position for betting stakes. She suggests you put yourself into a multiple fight competition since betting community will grant your matches a higher return as an unknown. Since you have no fight record at all, the returns should be excellent. You will only have one chance to this for major profit if you do well since the odds will go down with any subsequent fights.\n\nJane reckons you could walk away with up to a thousand credits profit if you place smart bets on yourself.

The taste is in your mouth……\n\nAs you stand up you feel the ache in your pussy, like a train has been through it. The worst part is you remember little, just wanting some stockings so badly. You went to Nicks?........ A salty flavoured belch with a bloated feeling stomach gives you an idea that you have been a proper cum dump. At least recently?\n\nYes, you went to Nick’s then what? Your legs say that you got some stockings, but then what? Clearly you were fucked big time, your internal implants are saying that 12 hours have elapsed.

When he found out that you were not he gleefully told you that it must have been strong //shit// you were taking as you were spouting off that the Master said that your slutty bod was for the taking.

You take your time, remembering your first lesson, and let your tongue massage her entire pussy, rather than focusing on a few key areas. Your technique seems to work as she relaxes and just softly sways her hips while letting out constant, low moans.

You thank her and head out on your way.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You do as you're told and don't hesitate to lick blindly at her exposed sex. Once you manage to get your bearings, you greedily start to drink down her juices when you notice that something seems off. Your licking starts to slow and you notice the texture is thicker and she tastes more bitter than most women. You keep licking as another glop runs out onto your tongue when you freeze and swallow.\n\n&quot;Figure it out yet, slut?&quot; she questions while pressing your face in harder as she leans you back with her weight. &quot;//I just got fucked good and now you're going to clean the creampie my date left you.//&quot;\n\nYou want to be repulsed but the humiliation of the revelation you're swallowing some mystery man's cum cause your pussy to spasm.

Did the mysterious man want you strapped naked in that bondage device? Perhaps that is why he left sounding so disappointed. \n\n&quot;Who knows,&quot; you think to yourself and remove the blindfold.

After you start shaking you take some time stretching out.\n\nThe rest of the day passes in the cell and you watch as Number 33 demonstrates her obedience to the guards by fucking them and sucking them off in multiple degrading situations and positions. When she eats her meal from a doggy bowl face first, you cringe. These people are fucking inhuman, though your feelings change subtly as the day goes past. You are slightly turned on when Number 33 is being fucked doggy style and the guard affectionately strokes the girls face. You know that this training is all for you to take in and understand.\n\nYou are later fed by a bowl too. No effort is made to get you to eat face first but it is a thick porridge and there is no spoon. Fingers don’t work well, nor does pouring it down your throat. In the end, you swallow your pride and give in; by the end your face is a mess. After you wipe your face with your arm, you are almost tempted to lick your arm clean, but stop short when you realize what that would signify. You take in that they are under feeding you and no doubt extra food will be given to good girls.\n\nWhen night comes, you lie down on your mattress and wonder whether the feeling earlier was down to the implants or just being terrified of the device. Other thoughts come unbidden into your head in the cold darkness and for the first time you seriously consider you might not be able to escape this place. You have no contact with the outside world and no way of getting any help.\n\nYour comms implant should have left a signal from the club until entering this complex when you were in the car, but did it? You were too intoxicated to follow what was happening and the implant does not keep detailed logs. You are required you put the query to the comms provider or it won’t update. Things don’t look good to change that any time soon since you can’t get a signal wherever they are keeping you. You... you are stuck in this place, naked, vulnerable, and no one may be coming to save you. For the first time in a very long time, you consider crying because of how hopeless the situation feels. A terrifing thought crosses your mind.\n\n&quot;//W-will I fail and end up like Number 33?//&quot;\n\n[[You shake as you come to terms with your rude awakening|KG4][$Mental += 4]] &lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC72&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</div><div tiddler="CamIntro" tags="" created="201607211659" modifier="twee" twine-position="6590,150">Her heels clicked down the tile hall as she followed the eager man rushing in front of her to his hotel suite. She had particularly enjoyed seducing this one; a married man, a senior corporate executive with a dark secret. He fumbled with his keycard at the door as she ran her fingers along his sides and down his legs before trailing them back up and grabbing his ass. He barely slid the card through before tumbling through the door in front of her eliciting a laugh from both of them. They start to kiss, her hands undoing the buttons on his shirt, then tossing it to the ground with little care. With a deft movement she pulls the laces on her panties, letting them fall to the ground. He pushes her back onto the bed and kneels down to begin kissing along her legs.\n\nShe spreads her legs open as his kisses travel up between her thighs with much fervour. For a married man she feels he is quite talented with his tongue and more eager to use it than most; his wife is a lucky woman. Content with his foreplay, she pulls him up and he hurriedly drops his pants to reveal his swollen cock.\n\nWith the hunger of someone fed by a dark fetish, he hitched up her dress further and slid his entire length inside her in a single thrust. He fucks her roughly, his cock pumping in and out of her slick pussy as she wraps her legs around him and grips the sheets. She pulls herself against him, grinding against his body as she pulls him as deeply as she possibly can. She teases him about being too gentle and he fucks her more roughly and grabs her throat and tightens his grip. He looks on with part lust and part annoyance as he struggles to choke the girl and with the other hand mauls her breast which elicits a grimace of pain.  She was pleased, the armoured windpipe enhancement did its work, stopping the man taking liberties on the girl he ‘paid for’. \n\nShe releases her legs and plants her feet on his chest to push him away. He looks on desperately as his cock slides out of her and bobs about, exposed to the cool air from the warmth that had enveloped it. The man looks annoyed and rants that he is the paying client, and she the plastic faced whore. She apologises and coaxes him on to the bed, then slides on top of him with the promise that she is the best. She began to ride him, swaying her hips as she sank down onto his cock. She digs her nails into his chest making him gasp at the foreign sensations and raising his ire again. She picks up her pace as her hands slide up and overlap around his neck. She smiles down at him as she lightly grips the sides of his neck and his breathing becomes shallower. The man starts to panic and tries to pull her arms from off around his neck, not liking the lack of control and confused why her arms do not move.\n\n&quot;Are you ready to cum for me, my man?&quot;  her velvety voice flows into his ears and penetrates into the primal part of his mind as he simply nods and looks frightened.\n\nShe grins at his concession and rocks her body against his as the muscles in her pussy work his cock in ways he's never imagined. Her grip around his neck begins to increase in pressure and his face turns red as his finally gives her what she wants. His cum splashes against her insides as her grip around his neck reaches almost inhuman levels. \n\nHis face starts to turn purple and he struggles but she continues to use his spasming cock as she stares into his flickering eyes. When he finally stops moving, she accidentally crushes his windpipe in the throes of her own orgasm. The realization of this only serves to cause her to cum on the now dead man's cock for a second time.\n\nShe rises of his softening member with a refreshed sigh when a vibration goes off in her ear. She takes one last look at her victim and hopes he understands, wherever he ended up, it was nothing personal. She was employed just to kill them and most of the targets in the high flying corporate world enjoyed elicit interactions. The vibrations continue as she waits to respond and she feels a small jolt run through her system for taking so long.\n\n&quot;''WHAT?!''&quot; she starts, irritated her moment is being interrupted. &quot;I see... That's not what I normally... Is that so...? No, Evindium isn't too far... As you wish.&quot;\n\nShe bites into her lip and draws a tinge of blood and hopes this new job will be even more pleasurable than the one she just finished. It was her first job after the accident, and the sex was better than ever, the enhancements perfect but she was a little disturbed that her face could show less expression. The ‘client’ noticed this and accepted it as the downside of using an escort agency where the girls could be abused. She was concerned, was this the end of her career or was she going to be just an assassin that could be only be a cheap hooker?\n\nPutting her panties back on, rearranging her dress she makes her way down to the foyer, to await her taxi.\n\n[[Continued....|CamIntro2]]\n</div><div tiddler="FW1.1" tags="Stat_12" created="201510222113" modifier="twee" twine-position="1270,850">You are offered a cowgirl outfit by the man and note the sheriff badge on the hat; you always wanted to be a sheriff as a little girl!

All the men seem a little bit unsure on what to do next, multiple hands are groping you, but no-one knows who should go first so you take the lead by picking one of them and grabbing his groin, telling him that he can fuck you first. This sets the sequence as your selection tells you to get on the bed and spread your legs, &lt;&lt;if $M4outfit is 2&gt;&gt;You let go of his groin, drop your panties and fling them over your shoulder towards Paul and then climb on the bed and spread your legs lewdly &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; You let go of his groin and then climb on the bed and spread your legs lewdly.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; After the man has stripped off and jumps on top of you and the gangbang begins. \n\nYou are on your second man when Paul joins in, he was close and your arm reached out and fondled his cock under his trousers.

The door opened and one of the men returned with a tray of drinks, and looked horrified when he saw Paul, then Helen barged in and took it all in. Paul went almost instantly limp and Helen started screaming, calling Paul a bastard and you a slut. The man who was fucking you stopped almost instantly and tried to hide as best he could in the room. The noise brought security and Helen screamed for them to sort you out, you find yourself dragged out of the room by the security staff, quickly followed by the others and an embarrassed naked man, who moments before was fucking you.

It does not take long and Paul is spent, thinking that his ‘mate’ may be getting Helen you tell Paul while the drugs are affecting him to admit to Helen what he has just done, and that Helen is a second-rate fuck, he just wants her for the money.\n\nPaul gets up, pulls his trousers up and agrees, getting emotionally distraught at the same time. Guilt, alcohol, truth and the drug all having conflicting effects on him. As he heads out the door you wipe your cum covered pussy on the bed sheets and head on out. Not wanting to be nearby when he meets Helen. As it happens Helen and the ‘mate’ are //talking// to Paul now, and it is getting really heated.

You adopt a number of provocative poses to help up the ante and then tell he can have you, but first he needs to strip naked and lie down on the bed.  Paul does so eagerly and in a drawer, you find some bondage gear. When Paul is naked and led on the bed you straddle his chest and cuff his arms to the bed posts. You lean over pushing your breasts into his face and whisper to him that he likes kinky sex. Paul repeats the words over and over again and you turn around to cuff his legs, totally aware that Paul can now look up your dress and see your panties.  As you cuff his legs you can hear Paul saying he wants your pussy so bad, you can feel him straining underneath you and a sidelong glance at a mirror shows him straining to look up your dress.

As he starts, under the alcohol, aphrodisiac and suggestion drugs you open the door to the room and beckon over a few bystanders. Soon a small crowd appears and you make your escape, laughing to yourself as Paul is getting hysterical, saying Helen is crap in bed and he really wants you.

When the interstellar colonization took off with the help of jump capable ships, the same technology was applied to the newly discovered worlds.\n\nColony worlds were mainly run by large corporations under the supervision of the [[Commonwealth]]. The Commonwealth kept an eye on corporate activities and made sure they didn’t strip mine entire planets and maintained a world suitable for human population. Creating desirable, habitable worlds that attracted new colonists and businesses was highly profitable venture in itself.  \n\nColony worlds were often an odd blend of high and low technology due to the cost of importing high grade materials and equipment. Often apart from the bare essentials needed to get the infrastructure going on a new world, local materials would be used for all other projects. It was not uncommon to see modern spaceports and skyscrapers contrasted against basic concrete or brick high rise apartment buildings that look like something built several centuries ago on Earth.\n\nThe first colony worlds, such as Mars are now part of the 6 core worlds which form the core of the human domain. The Commonwealth council has a tighter control of these worlds but struggles with age old problems of welfare, education and law and order.

Carla looks at you and walks into the bedroom where she sees the naked and restrained Shaun. You watch a terrified Shaun desperately try and explain that you are his teacher and offered to help coach him, that he was just doing it all to please Carla.\n\nCarla listens, but makes no reply as she reaches into the chest of drawers and pulls out a gag. With a deft, precise twirl of her hands, she gags Shaun and his pleading stops. The desperation in his eyes carry on the once verbal onslaught. She then closes the bedroom door and walks into the front room where you stood watching the whole thing unfold. Carla looks you over before speaking up.\n\n&quot;I can tell you are not scared or ashamed but the least you can do is take a seat and explain yourself. I'm not going to fight so you don't need to think about braining me with that thing,&quot; Carla says as she points to your makeshift weapon. \n\nYou nod put the item down and go to put your clothing on. As you do, Carla interrupts you.\n\n&quot;Please, stay as you are. Give me something to look at and while I try to feel out your true intentions,&quot; she asks with a false politeness to her tone. You nod once more, unfazed, and sit down in your underwear and wait for her to speak. After a small pause to contemplate things, she tells you to start from the beginning.\n\nYou explain what has happened so far: How you met Shaun, how you offered to teach him, and tonight were going to teach Shaun a lesson for trying to treat you like his property, although you were unclear on exactly how at the moment. You say this to gauge how Carla reacts; the woman is strange in a cold and analytical way. Carla evidentially feels the same and says she is curious about you because you have a dangerous look about you; the way you move, your confidence, and thats not to discount your defined physique. \n\n&quot;So you were going to fuck him and leave him cuffed, I'm guessing. Perhaps contacting me afterwards, so he would be rescued and punished?&quot; she inquires with one eyebrow raised.\n\nYou hold her gaze, &quot;Like I said earlier I had no clear plan, but something like that would have happened.&quot;\n\nCarla thinks for a second then speaks, &quot;I know you are a strong lady. You and I could become friends under the right circumstances. I'll let you in on a secret that Shaun does not even know,&quot; she pauses for a second, leaning in closer towards you. &quot;I work as a dominatrix in the Red Light District.&quot;\n\nSuddenly things click into place. Carla has been manipulating Shaun and you wonder if there is any love there at all. She seems to catch your thought process and simply says &quot;I'm fond of Shaun, but he worships me no matter what I do. You, on the other hand, are more like what I desire.&quot; With that, Carla leans closer still so that her cleavage is an arms length from your face. &quot;You came here for a fuck, lady with no name. Do you still want fucked well or are you going to get dressed and walk out that door like a scared, little mouse?&quot;\n\n[[Stay where you are|MArms2B2]]\n[[Get up to leave|MArms2B1A]]</div><div tiddler="MArms2B2" tags="" created="201508201842" modifier="twee" twine-position="2810,430">&quot;I still want to get fucked, of course,&quot; you say looking at Carla as she grins. She gives you a calculating look then quickly heads off to the bedroom, telling you to wait there for her. Not willing to stand around in your underwear, you take a seat on the sofa. Moments later Carla comes back and is totally naked except for a large strap-on bouncing along between her legs.\n\nYou take a look at it and smile up at Carla.\n\n&quot;I have to ask why you have a strap on at Shaun's. Do you make him squeal?&quot; you ask with a chuckle.\n\nCarla laughs too.\n\n&quot;I have not used it on him yet. I just keep threatening him with it. Give it time, but you should worry about yourself. Will it make you squeal if I shoved it up your ass?&quot; she inquires with a devilish smile.\n\nYou shake your head, &quot;I've had bigger, but just so we are on the same wavelength, that thing is //not// going up my ass.&quot;\n\nCarla giggles to herself, &quot;Maybe not tonight, but you know I'm a dominant one, so pull your panties off, my fuck slut!&quot;\n\nSitting on the sofa, you pull your panties down in a slow controlled manner, keeping your eyes locked with hers the entire time. Once they are off, you flick them towards her, spread your legs, and start playing with your pussy lips.\n\nYou beckon Carla over and she goes down on you, licking and the probing with her fingers until you are dripping wet and moaning. She lifts your legs up and you feel the tip of the dildo at your wet hole. Carla then gently pushes it in while carefully guiding it with her hand. Once the tip is in, she bucks her hips, backwards and forwards, slowly pushing the strap-on in deeper and deeper until it goes in all the way.\n\nJust as you are enjoying the feeling of being so thoroughly filled, Carla pulls out, swivels you around, climbs on the sofa, and then grabs your ankles and bends your feet back beside your head. \n\n&quot;My, you are flexible one,&quot; she exclaims before pushing the dildo back in and fucking you hard.\n\nPart of you knows your legs are more than strong enough to brake her grip, but as she pins your ankles, you can only gasp as your body shakes in submission to her dominance. Before long your pleasure hits its peak and you orgasm on the thick, plastic rod. Undeterred, Carla keeps thrusting into you, gentler this time, and demands that you 'accept your punishment' if you want her to stop.\n\n&quot;Punishment...?&quot; you pant.\n\n&quot;Yes. You were about to seduce my boyfriend again, were you not? You and Shaun need to be punished by my toys,&quot; Carla purrs as she bites her lower lip. \n\n&quot;Ok... Anything,&quot; you agree. Carla smiles and gives one last deep thrust before she pulls out of your dripping hole. \n\n&quot;I knew you would be sensible about it, but I want to hear you say it again,&quot; she says with a big grin on her face. \n\n&quot;//Damn, this is one kinky woman//,&quot; you think to yourself.\n\n[[Submit to her punishment|MArms2B3]]</div><div tiddler="MArms2B3" tags="" created="201508201914" modifier="twee" twine-position="3090,430">&quot;I'll do it,&quot; you say, looking deep into her eyes. &quot;I'll accept whatever punishment you have for me.&quot;\n\n&quot;Great!&quot; she says with a worrying grin. &quot;I will tell Shaun the good news. He must be wondering what is happening. You stay here.&quot;\n\nWith that Carla heads off into the bedroom to ungag Shaun and let him know what is going on. You remain on the sofa but it is clear what is happening once Shaun is ungagged as you heard the command from Carla to &quot;lick it,&quot; followed by Carla moaning. After a few minutes, Carla commands Shaun to stop and releases him from the restraints. When Shaun is free, he quickly asks what happened to &quot;Celeste&quot;. When Carla hears your name she calls out, &quot;Oh, so that is your name. Come and lie down on the bed, please, //Celeste//.&quot;\n\nYou do as you are told and you gain amusement from seeing the dumbfounded look on Shaun’s face from the whole thing. He still looks confused as you lie down on the bed and Carla straddles you and attaches the wrist restraints. You feel the sensation of Carla's pubic hair tickling your stomach as she moves. Like you did with Shaun, she restrains your arms but leaves your legs free.\n\n&quot;Now, Shaun,&quot; Carla explains, &quot;Both of you deserve punishment for not inviting me to the party. That is unacceptable, so to start, I want Celeste to suck your cock.&quot;\n\nShaun looks at Carla, confused, but his penis soon starts to become erect when he looks at your naked form.\n\nCarla glances over to you and says, &quot;Celeste, you need to spread your legs for me and close your eyes. Take Shaun's cock in your mouth when he manages to get it up.&quot; \n\nWith that, Carla laughs as Shaun, still unsure about everything, is struggling to get his cock rock hard. You close your eyes and after a minute or so you feel Shaun’s cock press against your lips. You open up and start sucking the head of his cock. Suddenly you hear a loud swishing noise that lands on your pussy with a smack and a sharp sting. \n\n&quot;Oww!&quot; you say in a garbled manner due to a cock shoved in your mouth. You open your eyes and see that Carla has got a paddle and you instinctively close your legs to protect your exposed pussy. Shaun moves to pull his cock out of your mouth but Carla interrupts him. \n\n&quot;Don't you dare pull your cock out of her mouth yet. It's time you guys learn the little game we are going to play tonight.&quot; She explains, &quot;I’ve worked out my punishment for you two. She is going to suck your cock and I'm going to smack her naughty pussy. For you Shaun, the worry is that she may bite down a little bit if I hit her too hard. Celeste, open your legs and show me your lower lips,&quot; she sternly orders. You groan but know you did agree to this punishment.\n\n&quot;How long will this last?&quot; Shaun asks.\n\n&quot;Til' you cum down her throat or beg my forgiveness, Shaun,&quot; comes her reply as she grins wickedly.\n\n[[Play this like a submissive cocksucker|MArms2B4]]\n[[Play this like a dominant piranha|MArms2B5]]</div><div tiddler="MArms2B4" tags="Stat_10" created="201508201938" modifier="twee" twine-position="3230,430">Tonight you will take your punishment like an obedient slut and suck the cum out of Shaun. The problem is having your arms pinned makes it very hard for you to move your head, push him closer, or play with his balls. Still, you have your tongue, lips and even your throat if he decides to throat fuck you. \n\nThe first few minutes you try your hardest but clearly Shaun is worried that you will bite down and tenses up every time the paddle comes down on your pussy. True to your thought process you don't bite down on his knob; the strikes only sting a slight bit. After a while, and due to the lust building up, Shaun starts to focus more intently on your mouth and his pleasure as the whooshing sound of the paddle is forgotten about.\n\nShaun’s thrusts increase in force and you try your hardest not to gag, breathing deeply while taking the increasingly harder slaps from the paddle. Carla also raises the stakes by trying the paddle on areas other than your pussy. Your breasts, belly, and the insides of your thighs are all fair game in her mind.\n\nYou can feel the increasing number of jerks from Shaun when his warm cum starts squirting into your throat. With triumph in his eyes, Shaun pulls out as his cum runs out of your mouth. He looks down at you panting to get your breath back and flicks the last few drops of cum from his cock onto your face. You have a coughing fit as some cum has gone the wrong way but you have a feeling of satisfaction. You sucked out his cum and ignored the delightful touch of the paddle.\n\n&quot;//Delightful...?//&quot; Your thoughts are odd today. \n\nWhile you finish sorting yourself out mentally, Carla releases you with a thoughtful look and tells you she hopes she'll get to see you again soon. You gather your clothes up and get dressed while Shaun walks off to take a shower.\n\nYou have a quick drink to wash out the taste of the cum and Carla reminds your about her place in the Red Light District on the way out.\n\n[[Return to your apartment|Apartment][$Days = $Days + 0.5]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC10&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Training = $Training + 1&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Mental = $Mental + 4&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Carla to 1.25&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $MArms to 5&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $CP to 1&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="MArms2B5" tags="Stat_11" created="201508201938" modifier="twee" twine-position="3370,430">You aren't into notion of having your pussy spanked all night and clearly Shaun is not man enough to keep his focus and his cock stiff.

Carla knows how flexible you are, and with an open invitation, the paddle comes down and you stiffen and clamp onto Shaun's cock with your mouth.\n\n&quot;Ow,&quot; he yelps and moves to pull out of your mouth before a stern look from Carla puts him off.\n\nShaun tries to carry on, but his cock is losing its stiffness, and at one point even slips out against your teeth.

His left hand cups your left breast underneath your bra while his right hand, fingers dripping from your pussy, reaches towards your mouth.\n\n&quot;Suck them,&quot; he says. You obey and suck his fingers tasting your own flavour. Once you have bobbed up and down his finger a few times he pulls them out of your mouth and straightens up. You hear him undoing his trousers and then feel his erection come to rest on top of your ass cheek. With his left hand on your hip and his right hand on his cock, he positions himself and slides into you. After a few gentles thrusts in and out, he then grabs your right hip and starts to increase his pace.\n\nThe man fucks you for about five minutes while alternating the strength of the thrusts, playing with your pussy and clit, and lifting your bra up so he is able to squeeze your tits.  When he can restrain himself no longer, he starts fucking you so roughly that you have to push back to avoid having your head bashed into the tunnel wall. The man soon climaxes inside of you and pulls out before giving your ass a slap to show he is finished.\n\nAs his cum starts dripping out of you, you hear him say, &quot;Right, I'm off lads. I’ll see you in a bit.&quot; The lads give their boss a high-five and another moves to take his place at your rear end. After the fourth fucking ends, you have orgasmed twice to the delight of the guards. The most recent orgasm was down to the fourth guard playing with your nipples and clit while he was fucking you. Still cuffed to the rail and feeling the spunk running down your legs, you know there is one guard left; the one you beat up,. You wonder idly what he is going to do to you. When you feel fingers in your gaping pussy, you know it is going to begin.\n\nInstead of just fucking you, the guard pushes spunk and pussy juice into your anus and presses you forwards so you are in more of an upright stance. Once you are positioned how he wants you to be he pushes his cock into your anus and starts to fuck you in the ass. His hands move all round your body, pinching your nipples and stuffing his fingers in your used pussy. It doesn't take long after he starts fucking you in the ass that he climaxes and you clench as hard as you can. The man then pulls out and with one last grope of your breasts he walks over to his colleagues. The two officers who cuffed you then release you and chuck some tissues your way.\n\nAs you pull yourself together, one of the guards says, &quot;You better hurry up. This entrance is being opened up and it is going to get busy.&quot; Laughter follows and they walk off. You quickly wipe yourself, pull your panties up and sort your bra out before the first people walk by and see you in your underwear. A man walks by and clearly spots the mixture of your and the guards cum still running down your leg. You quickly get your legs in your jumpsuit, grab your boots and walk out to the exit. Once outside, you sort your boots out and get your arms in the jumpsuit.\n\nWell... you have been royally fucked and treated like a complete slut. Shame burns deeply inside you. To be used in such a way and yet the worst part was that you enjoyed it. You even asked for it!

While you were running for the train, you heard a shout from the security officer telling you to stop. As you jump onto the train you wiggle your butt in his direction and as the doors start to close you turn round and cup your breasts upwards and wink suggestively at the same time.\n\nThe look on the guards face is amazing: both full of surprise and maybe a hint of amusement amidst the rage.\n\nYou know that you may regret this another day, but at the minute you are high on happiness and feel much more positive about this situation. Contrary to your worries, the train is not stopped and you get off at the next station where there are no security officers in sight.

You approach the Security Officer who has his back turned towards you. As you get closer you reach out and squeeze his butt and whisper in his ear, &quot;I'm really sorry, officer.&quot; You give him your best pleading look and the reaction on the officer's face is a mixture of rage, lust and fear; the latter causes him to reach for his stun baton in case another kicking is coming his way. Quickly you interject, &quot;No need for that, officer. I just want a private chat to sort this matter out like adults,&quot; you say with a wink.\n\nThe security officer looks at you, distrust clouding his face as he responds, &quot;I don't trust you bitch and you are in big trouble but... a chat can’t hurt. Just don't think about trying any funny business or you will be stunned.&quot; With that the Security Officer grabs your arm and with the other arm presses the stun baton into your back and leads you towards a nearby door. You give no resistance and let yourself be led onward, while giving your best butt swagger to help lighten and set the mood. As you get closer to the door, the guards ID badge causes it to slide open and you enter a small rest area with a few tables and chairs. \n\nThe room is empty and the guard lets go of your arm and reaches so that his left arm is on your upper chest, below your neck. His left hand grabs your right shoulder and the stun baton is pushed further into your back. You hear a crackle as he then gives you a little zap with the stun baton. This causes you to momentarily lose control of your body and you fall to the floor. The guard ensures you don't fall flat on your face and cushions your fall so you end up on your knees. \n\nNow kneeling behind you, he whispers into your ear, &quot;Listen bitch, no-one gets away with striking an officer on the metro, but I like your hot ass and I'm prepared to give you a second chance.&quot;\n\nYou retort back, &quot;Second chance? After you groped me on the train and have now shocked me without a reason. What if I report you, you son of a bitch?&quot;\n\nThe guard, expecting this, laughs and says, &quot;Nobody will care what you have to say-&quot;\n\nNow you play your bombshell, &quot;I hope you are prepared to take that chance, because I'm a level two [[visa]] holder.

Sarah grabs his balls with her free hand and squeezes causing him to thrash and kick out.  The knife ends up at his throat and Maloney freezes with fear and starts shaking. With that Sarah flings the knife to the side.\n\n“It’s pointless” she shouts.\n\nYou gesture her to come over and leave Maloney on the floor. You speak quietly with her and ask her what she thinking. Sarah tells you that she is thinking of any future investigation if there is blood all over the place. You tell her that the easiest way is to order the girl to flip Maloney over the balcony and then confess to the murder. Then it would be prudent to remove the girl from the equation as well. Sarah deflates at that saying the girl is innocent, you agree the girl is innocent, now a mindless sex slave, it is like killing a pet. Not nice.  Sarah understands and tells you that she did not think it would be this hard, but Maloney must die.\n\nYou join Sarah and apply ankle restraints to Maloney and call the girl over and tell her to follow. You then take Maloney to his 50th floor balcony and look down. You don’t want to drop Maloney onto some poor pedestrian, luckily for you the drop is onto a concrete roof of the car park. Pushing Maloney to the edge you tell the girl to grab his ankles and lift him up. Like a cantilever Maloney’s chest rests on the balcony and has his legs go up his head dips under the balcony edge.  The last you see is Maloney’s pleading eyes and muffled words due to the gag before gravity takes over and his head and chest starting heading downwards. The girl is dragged towards the edge of the balcony and tries to hold onto his ankles but is not strong enough and Maloney plummets to his death.\n\nThe girl in a does not compute mode chuckles, then looks worried “Mistress not happy?”\n\n“Mistress very happy” you reply. You then tell the girl that she needs to tell the concierge that she failed her old master by dropping over the edge of the balcony and then come back. You lead the naked girl down to the reception and watch out of sight. To be fair you could be in plain sight and the concierge would be unlikely to spot you, his eyes are glued to the naked woman walking in a seductive, swaying manner towards him. When she tells him what happened he looks absolutely shocked and starts muttering to himself that it is a windup. You watch a CCTV image appear and he quickly cycles through and spots the red splat and various body parts of Maloney. You watch the girl who is already getting into the elevator as the concierge looks up “Wait” he shouts but the lift doors are closing. You rush up the stairwell and get a lift up from the floor below.\n\nWhen you get back to the apartment Sarah has been busy wiping finger prints off surfaces just in case a basic investigation is started. The girl is stood waiting for instructions and you reluctantly tell her to jump off the balcony herself. The girl actually thanks you and smiles, before walking off, you wonder to yourself how much mind is left after the mind wipe process. Is there some part of the girl locked in her mind as a spectator? You know that to dwell on such thoughts is not good in this harsh world. \n\nAs you both make your way out of the building via a fire exit you notice that the concierge has called in a cleaning bot to sort out the mess. If luck goes your way then a cleaning bot will be used on the apartment so a new customer can be brought in as quickly as possible.  After all the apartment block needs paying customers and talk of murder puts people off from moving in.  The irony is that ‘suicide’ is quite common and cleaning bots have programmes for delicately collecting human remains for funerals.\n\nThe decision now is whether you recruit Sarah Tranter. You reckon for the short term she will have to live with you at your apartment, but you could introduce her to Jane, who would have someone to talk to. The key thing is what company Sarah would be, you don’t want to saddle Jane with a manic depressive, if she is.

The problem is you know he is right, it was really touch and go last time and now he has got over the surprise, studied your moves and learnt from the match. \n\nIf you are going to beat him you think you need to surprise him again, use your feminine charms on him as Rock is letting his dick do some of the thinking.  You could still chance a normal fight by not debasing yourself for an advantage, but there is a good chance you will be debasing yourself after the fight when the Rock takes his winnings.

Rock Lobster looks slightly disappointed but takes it with a smile and say he will spar with you before you go. You are then handed over to one of the coaches who talks through what your training plan is. You decide to warm up, do some bag work and then some short sparring rounds. The coach agrees and leaves you to the warm up and then heads off to arrange the sparring. There is no shortage of people who want to spar with you and six rounds are arranged for you with different fighters. Rock Lobster is number three.\n\nThe sparring is fun, it reminds you of the military days before your first batch of enhancements in special forces infiltration. You are better and faster than all of your opponents except from Rock Lobster. Still Rock Lobster wants to spar at range giving the advantage to you, you get the logic is that he knows that is where you hold the advantage and it is better quality training. The round goes well, as do subsequent others with Rock. A lot of the gym break off from what they are doing to watch you spar with Rock and when you finish people start to talk to you.\n\nYou felt wrong, going to the fight club to con some money out of the betting syndicates and showing up some decent fighters. The humiliations are not common among fighters, most have a code where they don’t do it to people they respect, nor do many pretend to be a novice fighter. To be fair as most of the fighters are home grown on Evindium there are not many secrets, just visitors or newcomers from other planets. You tell them that you are ex-military and needed the money, the reason you came back and sparred was that you felt a little guilty, and miss the camaraderie. You are told that you can come back to the gym anytime you like but you know that you don’t have the time. So regretfully you say you might and say your goodbyes.\n\n[[Return to Apartment|Apartment]]\n&lt;&lt;set $Days to $Days + 0.5&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $RockGym to 4&gt;&gt;\n</div><div tiddler="KS1.12" tags="" created="201510310746" modifier="twee" twine-position="2810,2810">The next room has bright lights in the centre and deep shadows around the sides, an effect enhanced by the gleaming chrome centre-piece and the dark velvet upholstery and wall-coverings. As you step towards the lights in the middle, the door shuts behind you and the lock clicks. You've come this far and you're going all the way, so they needn't have bothered, but being locked in here fits with the theme.\n\nSoft footsteps and the rustle of robes approach you from each side, and you wait to be taken the rest of the way through this test. A hand takes each of your wrists from in front, another each of your upper arms from behind, and you are walked forwards to all that chromed steel. You don't look at the men holding you. That's part of the theme, too, of course, and you're with it all the way. \n\nYour arms are bent at the elbows, you are bent forwards at the hips and your wrists are held over two metal frames with smooth scoops in their tops. The upper parts are swung over and click down on top of your wrists, locking your hands in places. Between the two is a larger version of the same thing, and without needing to be guided to it you lay your neck on this. The top locks down, securing you in place. With some clicking, the frames holding your wrists are slid along rails to get your elbows at exact right-angles.\n\nSomeone wants to get every detail of this right. Your ankles are moved into clamps on the floor and positioned to put your hips at a right-angle too, you're sure that this is a show and that it will be seen by people beyond the participants. You're also sure that the droplets of water still lingering on your skin from the shower aren’t the only way you're wet right now.\n\nYou ought to be terrified and looking for a way out, but instead you're excited to be going through with this; getting your mission, getting closer to resolving your problems on this planet, and getting yourself and Jane out of here are all that matter. You don't deny to yourself that you're also excited just to be going through with this. A bare metal bar presses up the fronts of your thighs and against your hip-bones, holding you up, the tingling inside you grows unbearable. You don't just want this. You need it, to be taken right now, hard, by anyone.\n\n[[You become overwhelmed and everything passes in a blur|KS1.13]]\n[[You’re going to burn every second of this into your mind|KS1.12A]]</div><div tiddler="KS1.13" tags="Stat_26" created="201602131751" modifier="twee" twine-position="3090,2810">You have no idea how many of them there were, nor how many times you came as they rammed themselves into your helpless body. You can tell by the heavy mass of your hair plastered to your face and neck; by the cum cooling on your back, slithering down your legs and the sides of your breasts; and mostly by how very sore your vagina is, that there were a lot of them and they came many, many times. Your butt-cheeks are sore too, probably bruised black and blue. You wouldn't even be surprised to find you were bleeding in a few places. You seem to have made it, though. They've stopped and withdrawn, leaving you to cool off where you are, dripping head-to-toe with cum.\n\nThe gag is suddenly taken from your mouth. Your jaws ache too much to be closed and you wait, mouth hanging open, for everything else to be removed. The blindfold stays in place and the restraints stay closed. There is near-silence around you for another long minute, then a voice. It tells you about your mission. You nod, still unable to speak, at various points. Then something ice-cold presses against your pussy lips and quickly slides deep inside.\n\nIt's smooth and hard, like a marble or a ball bearing, and big enough to stretch you as it goes in. It stops against your cervix and you can feel a narrower shaft behind it; you’re at least they have a way to get it back out. A hard point presses to your clit, there's a click, and buzzing agony fills your over-worked pussy between the two. There's another click and it stops. Your breath returns to you in a gasp.\n\nThe voice speaks again, asking questions about the mission, asking you what you did, who you spoke too, all in minute detail. Every long pause for an answer brings another electric shock between your cervix and clit, right through your g-spot. Eventually, after a round of trick questions that made you wonder how big a hole they were going to burn in you, the restraints are unlocked. You are lifted by the arms, dragged to a lift, and dropped there. You are told that your payment will be made to your nominated account. &lt;&lt;if $carbug is 1 or $bedbug is 1&gt;&gt;They tell you that if you missed a bug in the bedroom or car they will deduct 500 credits from the total.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\n\nThe doors close, the lift rises, and when they part next you are looking at the lobby where you entered. Sitting in front of the lift are your clothes in a heap on the floor. The doors all have red &quot;locked&quot; lights on, except the exit. There is, of course, no way to wash yourself clean off all of the cum before you call a taxi; they really didn't mind humiliating you. \n\n[[Return to your apartment a cummy mess|Apartment]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC26&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Training = $Training + 4&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Mental = $Mental + 10&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;if $carbug is 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $Credits = $Credits - 500&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;if $bedbug is 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $Credits = $Credits - 500&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Credits = $Credits + 1500&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $KS to 5&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="KS1.10" tags="" created="201510310803" modifier="twee" twine-position="2390,2810">You may be horny again already, but you came here to get through whatever this place is, not to stay in this lovely shower and get yourself off again and again. \n\nYou get to your feet, open the sliding door, and step out.

You stroke your own body, starting with your shoulder and neck, and then your stomach, before moving to your breasts. \n\nYou wouldn't stop them. You'd be open to all their touching and feeling. You move your shoulders back and lift your chest up, offering your breasts to these imaginary companions. You wouldn't just be passive, though. You'd be touching them too. You’d beckon someone closer and tilt your head back to lick an imaginary pussy above you. You lap away at your phantom partner as water rushes into your mouth then overflows at the sides, down your neck, and through your cleavage, picturing the smell and taste of her juices. \n\nIt wouldn't be just women, either. They'd want to see you with men. There'd be a hard cock against your cheek and you'd turn to it. You stroke your own cheek where it would be and mime curling your fingers gently around it and turn your head that way. You'd open your mouth wide and it'd slide right in, tasting faintly of shower gel and man.\n\nYou slip your own finger into your mouth and taste only yourself. Still, you lick and suck that finger while your other hand slips down over your tight abs to dives between your legs. Maybe he'd be taller than you and have to thrust down into your mouth. Leaning back and tilting your head up, you can almost feel him pulling your hair back to give himself a better angle. He'd bend over you, his cock ramming hilt-deep into your welcoming, hungry mouth. You have to move your hand to catch your breath. But you know he he wouldn't be so gentle. You'd half-choke on it, trapped between him and the floor. \n\n[[Get lost in your fantasy of a shower orgy|KS1.1A]]</div><div tiddler="CF6" tags="" created="201507272154" modifier="twee" twine-position="3230,4490">After taking a good beating Kat quits and taps out.

For the coup de grace you apply a rear chocker hold.\n\n&lt;img src=data/cage9.png&gt; \n\nThe girl can't do a thing, you really have two choices; knock her out and end the fight, or play with her?\n\n[[Knock her out|CF2A]]\n[[Play with her|CF2B]]</div><div tiddler="CF3" tags="" created="201507272120" modifier="twee" twine-position="1690,4490">Your thirty minutes of recovery time seems to be over in a heartbeat and it is on to your next fight with the Wrestler. This man is a lump of muscle with no modifications, but he is still probably stronger than you and definitely has the weight advantage. If he gets a good hold on you it will likely be game over for you. The trick here is to keep moving and striking until he goes down.\n\nAs he enters the ring you can't resist checking out his package; it would seem he is a big boy in more ways than one. The wrestler spots your roving eyes and smiles.\n\n&lt;img src=data/cage29.png&gt;\n\n&quot;I'll go easy on you when I shove it in your pussy, girl. You better have it wet and ready for me&quot; he taunts.\n\nYou say nothing back and just grin. You let him make what he wants of this but your mind wanders and you get a hot flush as you remember seeing some of his previous matches. He loves to wrestle good looking girls down and then have his way with them. As your mind wanders the wrestler shakes his arms in the air, working the crowd.\n\n&lt;img src=data/cage28.png&gt;\n\nYou briefly imagine yourself in their place, defeated, and a familiar tingling sensation starts down below as your nipples visibly press into the fabric of your shirt. Your thoughts come to an end when you look over at the Wrestler and notice he is now staring at your tits.\n\n&quot;I’m going to make you tap out and squeal like a pig, missy,&quot; he says using his left hand to highlight the outline in his jockstrap. Part of you wants to beat him senseless and the other wants to bet he can't make you squeal. You realize your lust filled thoughts are starting to get the best of you and you need to focus as you start to ready your attack.\n\n[[Keep your distance.

The man says nothing as he walks to the impalement device and drags it until it is in-between your legs, roughly at knee height.\n \nYou resist the urge to kick the man and instead note that the pointy bit of the device is touching the sides of your knees. This quickly changes as the man turns the ratchet and the device starts to rise.\n \n&lt;img src=data/m6.png&gt;\n \nAs it starts moving closer to your groin, another man enters who is dressed in the same way. This man walks behind and holds your hips while the device spreads your legs as it draws closer to your sex. When it hits your groin, your lips part, and it starts to painfully lift you up into the air. The two men then check that everything is set properly and you cannot pull yourself off the device. They then leave you as silently as they entered.\n \n&lt;img src=data/m7.png&gt;\n\nYou then spend the time after this trying to hold your weight on the chains. By alternating your feet on the ratchet mechanism you sometimes manage to stop yourself from being impaled. While the throne worked on the same principle, this thing is blunter and more brutal, but you will endure. You know that it will come to an end but a small part of you worries that they will leave you here.\n \nThe pleasant but concerning thing is that you aren’t very bothered by the discomfort.

Either reveal yourself,&quot; he says as he jumps back, lowering his sword as he goes for his sidearm, &quot;or I will end this with my pistol.&quot; \n\nYou need to react quickly or he’s not going to be wrong.\n\n[[Strike at his hand going for the pistol|MRE5B1]]\n[[Try to cleave through his helmet while he is open|MRE5B2]]</div><div tiddler="MRE2" tags="" created="201507072232" modifier="twee" twine-position="290,5750">You had thoroughly searched two of the rooms for what you were looking for and still had not managed to find any armour. All that is left is one last room, otherwise you will need to try out your luck in the barracks. Your mind starts to drift off to what it would be like if you got caught again, but before you have the chance to get lost in thought you hear the sound of footsteps approaching. \n\nYou do your best to look like you’re a proper cleaner and don't plan on making eye contact while you shuffle around. The footsteps get closer and with a sinking feeling you know that they are definitely headed for the same room you are currently in. There is a sudden deafening silence and you nearly freeze as you try to look convincing.\n\n&quot;Look at me, wench,&quot; bellows the voice of a man clad in armour. You timidly look up at his mask, lightly shaking, as you do your best to impersonate a scared cleaner. There is an unnerving pause while the Evictor inspects you.\n\n&quot;You are quite a good looking thing, I'm surprised that the cleaning company sent you,&quot; chuckles the man evilly. &quot;You either did something wrong or they must not like you very much.\n\n&quot;The last good looking cleaner that ventured into the barracks, and I could hear her squeal, scream, and moan for hours before they got done with her. Don't worry that pretty, little head of yours though. You are in an officer’s quarters and you shall be treated like a lady should.&quot; \n\n&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; you meekly reply as you try to walk off. The armored man steps up closer and blocks the path in front of you.\n\n&quot;Not so fast there. You will be thanking me for this soon enough, but first I need you to clean my room. Follow me,&quot; he orders as he grabs you by the elbow and propels you forwards and towards his room. Before you are pushed, you manage to read his name plate, ‘Sub-Commander Drake’. This as perfect for you as he is the second in command then. \n\n&quot;Right, girl,&quot; he says with a smug chuckle. &quot;Do your business and get to dusting and stuff. Oh,&quot; he adds, &quot;give me your access pass as well. I don't want you sneaking out while I am getting changed.&quot; \n\nWhen you hesitate to give up your pass, he begins to unstrap his sword from his armour back plate. You get the message loud and clear and hurriedly pull out the access pass and give it to him. \n\n&quot;I'm going to lock the door and clean up,&quot; he says in a gruff voice. &quot;I think you are overdressed, so take it all off before I get back. If you don't, then I will just rip it off you.&quot; With that the man gives you one last smirk, clearly pleased with himself, then thumps over the door, locks it and goes over to his walk in armour closet and disappears inside.\n\nYou know it will take ten minutes or so for the man to remove his armour. During that time he will be unable to see you and it will probably be your only chance to get around freely before you deal with him. The apartment-like quarters consists of a lounge by the entrance and doors to the armour closet, the bedroom, and a shower room. Ten minutes will pass all too quickly so you need to decide what you plan to do.\n\n[[Search the apartment for weapons|MRE2A]]\n[[Strip as commanded then search for weapons|MRE2B]]\n[[Strip off and cleanso you don't anger him|MRE2C]]</div><div tiddler="MRE3" tags="Stat_56" created="201507072232" modifier="twee" twine-position="1270,5750">You follow the instructions and dig your fingers into your butt cheeks as you spread them wide open. You try and relax your anus as much as possible for the inevitable fucking that is to come. Drake watches your efforts for a few seconds, laughs, and then feel him press this head of his cock against your rear entrance. \n\nIt is a tight fit at first but your body stretches to accommodate the forced entry in spite of some heavy friction. After a few attempts, he pulls back out and declares he needs some lube. With that, he whistles a tune and a hatch just above the bed opens up. You glance up and see a large combat knife on a plinth, a few other items, and the lube the man is reaching for. \n\nYou give the knife your undivided, discreet attention and come to the conclusion that it is a very real, very sharp knife. You wished to yourself for a moment that they made modifications to give telescopic arms so you could reach it. Unfortunately got you, your current situation is summed when you are told to spread once more and the cold lube hit makes you jolt.\n\nThe Sub-Commander tosses the tin of lube down by your face and slides the tip of his cock into your ass causing you to inhale sharply. Your hands, still on your ass cheeks, are grabbed at the wrists, and the man begins to mercilessly plough you as he brutally thrust himself as deep as he can from the start.\n\nThe rough fucking carries on for a seemingly long time and your arms feel like they are being wrenched out of their sockets as the man keeps pulling on them. Then, with a grunt from the man. you feel his hot cum flood inside your butt and the pressure falls away from your arms. The hands go to your ass and the man finally pulls his cock out leaving your ass agape. \n\n&quot;Time to suck it, bitch. Turn around and clean off your mess!&quot; he orders. \n\nThis is the perfect opportunity and you try to keep your eagerness from showing in your posture. You look at him as you turn and he gestures you closer. You know exactly where the knife is but still need the right moment to turn around and spring towards it. Planning ahead, you move towards the still erect cock, wrapping your mouth around it, and start to alternate between licking it and then bobbing up and down.\n\nAs the man relaxes, his arms drop down by his sides and he leans back. You make your move by biting down on the head and grabbing his testicles with both hands, squeezing with all of your might as you pull on them. You feel blood squirt into your mouth and hear the man scream. You then release the partly severed penis, jumping to your feet, and kick the off balance man in the chest which sends him tumbling backwards. \n\nYou turn back and grab the knife off the plinth and look back to see the Drake coming right for you. With the knife in your hand, you launch a series of kicks and jabs his way. One blow slams him into the wall and gives you an opportunity to stab him in his abdomen. The fight is won, but he still puts up a good dying struggle by trying to throttle you before blood loss ends it. \n\nCovered with blood, you make your way to the armour closet which is thankfully open and you start to armour up.\n\n[[Finally in disguise, you move out|MRE4]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC56&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;&lt;set $Mental = $Mental + 2&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;set $Training = $Training + 2&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Intel 13 Start" tags="" created="201508250901" modifier="twee" twine-position="4770,4630">For the cost of five-hundred credits, the safety of Jane and to a lesser extent the Magnum makes it easy to agree to the deal with the smugglers. This is costing you a small fortune but anyone competent will search the main hangar complexes eventually. You make the assumption that they will search for you just in case there are any clues.\n\nThe smugglers, true to their word, have planned the mission with a high level of professionalism that would put some outfits to shame. The operation is done at night and when there is construction work nearby, which masks the noise of the Magnum landing. The warehouse complex itself is deserted as the warehouses and hangars are not being used and the warden has been bribed. Security is low anyways as no-one wants to burgle an empty warehouse that will at most contain building materials.\n\nThe only thing bothering you is the trustworthiness of the warden and you pass your fears across to the team leader. You are told that the smugglers work for a criminal gang and crossing the gang would be bad for the warden’s family. The corporations are thankfully not known for their generous rewards either. Satisfied you stop your questions.\n \n[[Check out the site|Intel13.1]] &lt;&lt;set $Credits -= 500&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;set $Int13 to &quot;Complete&quot;&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="MRE1" tags="" created="201507072223" modifier="twee" twine-position="150,5750">You prefer the idea of comfortably walking around this place dressed as an Evictor. This way if you are spotted, you will at least be armed with a weapon or two to give you a sliver of a chance to escape. The Evictor’s had earned their namesake from how could they were at carving up their enemies and often carried swords and knives to reinforce that terror. When it comes down to it, you’d rather take a bullet or two rather than have your guts pulled out by a grinning psychopath. \n\nYou refocus on the mission and know your best option is the officer’s quarters as you are less likely to run into someone who will challenge you. You recall from your briefing mentioning that the last good looking cleaner that went to the general barracks got gangbanged until she was unconscious and nearly drown from the cum. While a twisted part of you is excited by the thought of being tossed around by these monsters, you have a mission to complete and if you’re caught you will end up hobbling out of here without the data.\n\n//&quot;That would just mean you would have to come back again,&quot;// you think to yourself as you start to feel warm. You shake your head and clench your fists as you refocus your mind on the task at hand.

Your only option to escape is to take one of the Evictor crafts for a 'victory' spin and hope this isn’t unusual. \n\nYou walk out of the Commander’s room with his severed head held above yours to signal your victory. You find yourself walking past rank upon rank of gathered Evictors and as you walk up to the roof you note that they are walking behind you. \n\nTo limit the chance of being followed, you walk over to a single person skybike. You raise the ex-Commander’s severed head on more time before tossing it to the nearest Evictor. You mount the bike and fire up the engine and bring it to a hover before shooting off\n\nIt does not look like the Evictors are following you and you head out of town as quickly as the bike will let you. You wonder if your actions with plunge the Evictor's into shock, outrage, and confusion when you finally reach your rendezvous point. You ditch the skybike in an alley and quickly get on the escape vehicle. You escape just in the nick of time as ten minutes later an Evictor interceptor comes roaring overhead.\n\n[[Mission Debrief|Mission 6 Debrief]]</div><div tiddler="Int19.2" tags="" created="201607272159" modifier="twee" twine-position="5050,5470">Hostesses are allowed to invite guests with management’s approval so you request to have him meet you there. When you ask the management, approval is almost instantaneous and you are even congratulated on your catch. This is one of the first times Evindium is playing host to such a big production and all of the corporations in the planetary council will profit from the show. More Importantly, Shebo stands to rake in some serious profits in the short time the production is on planet. Many of Shebo’s wealthier customers will want to rub shoulders with the executives just to break some of the monotony of corporate life while making new connections.\n\nWhat surprises you about this arrangement is when management offer you three hostesses for your customers along with their own private room. &lt;&lt;if $Carla is 1&gt;&gt;You consider asking Carla if you can borrow a riding crop&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You consider purchasing a riding crop&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; to set your uniform apart and demonstrate your position above the other hostesses. Your fantasies of lording over the other hostesses continue until you realize that they get to leave at the end of their shift while you will probably be on your hands and knees servicing some executive’s cock. &lt;&lt;if $Mental lte 50&gt;&gt;Maybe the hostesses have gotten the better end of the deal after all...&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Part of you feels like you’re still getting the better end of the deal in this.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\n\nYou wait for your executive while holding a name card in the space port, already dressed in your Shebo outfit. Unsurprisingly, you get a few stares and catcalls as you are wait for a man named Charles and his flunkies to arrive. When he does turn up, he is everything that you expected: a well presented man in his early forties. He is accompanied by a prim and proper female who looks like a news anchor and a slightly disinterested man with a hardened look. \n\nAs you show Charles to a limousine Shebo provided you, introductions are made. Charles is the Executive Producer on the show, the lady is Clarice and she is the Director of Media, and Bertram is the Director of Filming. Clarice listens to the audience to support their favorites along and Bertram is there to get the best footage of people; especially the kill shots that draw in the viewers. Charles sounds so positive about all of this that you can’t help smiling even though you know the show caters specifically to these people.\n\nWhen you arrive at Shebo’s, the management team are quick to relegate you to taking drinks orders in the private room. Once everyone is settled, the hosting Shebo Director explains why the club has its name as three naked hostesses are walked in, chained to each other by neck collars.  Charles is told that these girls are to be furniture for him and his guests.\n\nA series of challenges and tasks are provided in which everyone has to bet on a girl who will last the longest on a device. If the guests win they will earn free drinks and the hostesses will have to perform whatever forfeit was determined. Winning hostesses will receive tips to keep the challenge going. \n\nYou get to strap the girls in but are also required to join in with the drinking games. As the evening goes on, everyone gets increasingly drunk apart from the hostesses who have moved away from the physically demanding bondage to fuck machines. You’re now quite drunk but are responsible for keeping the girls lubed up so that the machines can be left on maximum. The good news is that Charles and his compatriots have started talking and you have learned quite a bit.\n\nClarice has given lots away and seems to be very intrigued with you; you even caught her looking at your throne trial and showing it to an impressed looking Bertram. When it is shown to Charles, he says you could make it as a Hunter on the show with skills like that. He tells Clarice to make some notes about arranging a ‘Huntress’ competition with pussy hooks while winking at you. \n\nEventually Charles says it is time to call it an evening and that he hopes you can provide some relief in the limo since Clarice just asked for raise while shooting her a tipsy smile. She smiles back but when his back is turned the look turns to pure venom. Bertram still looks disinterested and Charles tells you not to worry about him; he is always dour but good at what his job. During the limo ride, Charles leans back in his reclining chair with you between his legs, sucking him off like a good little whore while you listen to him discuss the show with his associates. \n\n[[Stay between his legs until you reach your destination|Int19.3]]</div><div tiddler="MRE4" tags="" created="201507072232" modifier="twee" twine-position="1410,5750">The officer’s disguise works well and you are soon at the Evictor Commander’s operations room. You wonder what will be necessary to gain access but realize that you need not bother as the door is unlocked. You can only guess the security is so lax because they just can't conceive the idea of anyone infiltrating there headquarters and impersonating a killed officer. The outer door to the complex //was// guarded by an Evictor, but he just saluted and let you through once he saw your uniform.\n\nYou quickly find the computer mainframe and insert the hacking tool which quickly uploads the software. Maddock says this is a hit and miss tactic, so your backup is to secure the data core to guarantee the success of the mission. As you start looking for the core, the bending and searching makes you notice that this armour is really rubbing you raw and your tits are also really squashed. Luckily, you swiftly locate the data core and soon have it out through the waste disposal as discussed.\n\nNow you have to decide how you’re going to assassinate the Evictor Commander. You scan the office and note a few hiding places and a sword that you could use. There are no firearms in the Sub-Commander’s room and you know that only the on duty guards carry a firearm. You could try and assassinate the Commander with a sword but you wonder to yourself what would happen if the Commander brings his own gun or a couple of bodyguards with him and realize is clearly very risky.\n\nYou decide to search the room more thoroughly in case you have missed anything. As you are doing this, one thing does catch your eye; a holo video on pause with lots of nudity in it. Curiosity makes you resume the video and you are soon confronted with someone in a cleaner’s uniform on the floor and a barrack room of Evictor mercenaries crowding around her.\n\nYou realize this must be the 'attractive cleaner' Drake was referring to, and she is on her back, on top of a table, with an Evictor thrusting between her spread legs. The camera moves closer and you note that she is a short, petite blond and looks very familiar. You can't see the woman’s face as the camera is angled towards the Evictor who is banging her roughly. When the camera does swing around, a cold chill runs through you.\n\n&quot;Oh my goodness,&quot; you say in shock. &quot;That’s Claire!&quot;\n\nClearly Maddock sent Claire in here first and she failed the mission and earned the unfortunate privilege of being gangbanged by a whole load of Evictor mercenaries. You watch on in a mixture of rage and arousal; fifty studs having their way with you is quite a challenge. \n\nYou get wetter watching the video and your armored hand moves to your armored groin causing you to give a moan of frustration. You watch a little more before brining yourself to your senses as you try and repress your lustful thoughts. Your fate would be more than a little unpleasant if you were caught by the Evictor Commander rubbing yourself off.\n\nA loud chime in the helmet announces the return of the Commander and it quickly becomes clear that he is aware you are in his office.\n\n[[Prepare yourself for his arrival|MRE5]]</div><div tiddler="MRE5" tags="" created="201507072233" modifier="twee" twine-position="1550,5750">A cold voice crackles through your armors communications system.\n\n&quot;So, Drake, I see you have finally laid down the leadership challenge by entering my office unbidden, to fight as men with only our blades. You are a fool for doing this since you have never bested me in training. I guess the chance to gain advantage while I am out of favour with HQ was too much,&quot; his voice displaying a chilling stoicism.\n\nYou don't reply, your thoughts whirling through your head. Clearly by entering the office in the armour of Sub-Commander Drake, you have accidentally issued a challenge to the Commander for his position. There are no chance to quietly escape now, so you grab the sword and start to get its feel and balance. \n\nAs you slip into a rhythm of practice strikes, your mind wanders back to the video of Claire. Your friend was forcefully getting used as a cum-dumpster and yet you ended up getting aroused by it; you can’t believe a normal person would ever react that way. The thoughts are not helping your impending fight so you let the drift away and focus on the sword.\n\nWith a few more swings and a test slice through the Commander’s desk, you now know that this is more of a chopping weapon. You note that it has a spike like protrusion, jutting towards you at the top end of the blade. You further test out the cutting edge and the spike on a few objects in the room. Your conclusion is that while the spike is effective at tearing through objects you pierce, the cutting edge would likely cut straight through armour joints.\n\nYour thoughts are interrupted as the doors open with a hiss and in steps the Evictor Commander, sword in hand.\n\n&quot;I did not think you would be foolish enough to do this, Drake. Even with me out of favour, I am still better swordsman than you’ve ever been,&quot; says the Commander as he appraises you. \n\nYou say nothing but the Commander continues to stare you down.\n\n&quot;Take off your helmet, Drake,&quot; he commands as his voice booms through his helmet. &quot;I want to see the fear in your eyes when I cut you down!&quot;\n\nYou weigh up your options: Drake was used to fighting with these swords and in armour, you are not. Losing the helmet would probably be an advantage for you, but if he calls in the guards you’d be screwed.\n\n[[Take the helmet off|MRE5A]]\n[[Leave it on and attack|MRE5B]]</div><div tiddler="FM2.2" tags="" created="201712102038" modifier="twee" twine-position="850,6450">The warehouse area is huge, and quite busy and fully automated.

This would be considered an act of war by Xena by some parts of the Commonwealth, or at the very least would lead to major criminal investigation and massive reform. \n\nYou could head back to Maddock’s extraction point, the video footage you have taken should be enough.

I think it was the implants, either being sent some signal, or identifying the situation. I find it worrying” Constantine replies, rambling and repeating himself.\n\n“I hear she fractured your skull” Kushiel replied, laughing as did so, a haughty superior laugh. \n\n“Yes” comes the slow reply, “she broke out of the trance and beat me up” Constantine says feeling embarrassed.\n\n“I agree that it was the implants that broke the trance, what I am not sure is whether it was an automatic reaction, or there is someone monitoring her, I’m monitoring comms traffic at the moment with the car, her implants are sending a lot of data out” Kushiel states matter-of-factly, now professional and no longer baiting Constantine. “I read your report as well, about how ripe she was for the plucking, I agree it is very unusual for a military type, especially for an independent one” Kushiel continues.\n\n“You know why I picked her up at my shop, it was because of the association with Sid, one of my slaves at the visa bureau got a hit on our intelligence database” Constantine adds.\n\n“Yes, our military slaves have given us some good data, I looked at her records, military infiltrator. What I could not decide on is whether she fully works for Sid, or is a freelance” Kushiel questions Constantine.\n\n“Now the reason I went to bring her in was because I thought she worked for Sid, we have had our run-ins with Sid as you know. So when I questioned her she was adamant that she was a free-lancer, truly believed it, she didn’t really work for anyone else though” Constantine responds.\n\nKusheil does not respond at first, but ponders and then speaks “So Sid is running a programme, very primitive, a bit like training a dog via controlled stimuli via high tech implants. Somewhat like a drug addiction, but to change a behaviour, so certain behaviours get a response, this Celeste is being trained I think, so I agree that you said part-trained. What worries me is the implant CPU’s can detect hypnotism and counter with body stimuli, it could work” says with a hint of worry in normally calm and cold voice.\n\nConstantine nodding in agreement asks the basic question; “So what is the plan then?”\n\n“The plan is simple Constantine, the place we are going will block all comms traffic, we will monitor all traffic out and what her implants are doing. We will then put out some stimuli, test response to submission and sexual boundaries. If we are right, her implants will encourage behaviour through chemical release” Kusheil explains, pauses and then continues matter-of-factly “at the end Celeste will either be broken and we will bring her into the fold, or we will let her go, supplying her the information about Sid, with any luck she will damage the organisation”.\n\n“It will certainly send a message, one way or another” Constantine says ending with a chuckle.\n\nThe pair sit quietly, and then start discussing the test scenarios.\n\nBefore the car reaches its destination Kushiel with a sly smile tells Constantine that there will be one other twist, there will be some hypnotists in the staff, to test if there are any in-built defences in Celeste’s implants. Constantine smiles, Kushiel will no doubt give a few juniors a few tests on Celeste.

You take control of the grip, flick off the safety, and fire a round, narrowly missing her foot.

Still watching her, you go over to Crimson Talon’s rifle before emptying the magazine and the round inside of the chamber. You put it back on the ground and step out of her immediate view.

Your mine will be simple enough to arm, you’ll just need to be fifty meters away to avoid having your implants fried. The mine is quite advanced and the jetbike only has to enter a one-hundred-meter radius of the device to set it off.\n\nYou choose your ambush point carefully so that it will look like you were spotted in the open while running towards cover. The cover has to be close enough so you don’t get immediately killed and you can get the bike to fly within range of the mine. When the bike misses you on the first pass, it will likely circle and then the mine will cause its engine to fail.\n\nYou wait and recall the information you’d dug up on this ex-military freak that is this rounds hunter. Going by the operating name Death Bladez, he has a high-tech, reinforced blade inserted in each of his forearms. These blades extend out from inside his arm and he’s known to swipe at people from the jetbike. Even if they’re smart enough to go to ground, he’ll switch gears and land nearby to flush them out on foot.\n\nOnce he catches up with them, he doesn’t care whether he gets to jump straight to hand-to-hand combat or the contestant starts to flee. Some contestants attempt to set up ambushes where the can thrown rock but they’re quick to learn his forearm blade is not the only augmentation he possesses. Metal plates and bone strengthening enhancers line his skull and neck as well.\n\nYou hear the whir of the bike heading towards your location you make a mad dash towards some nearby rocks a bit over sixty meters away and dive for cover. You lay there you wonder if Death Bladez has taken the bait and are rewarded when the jetbike roars past and then starts to circle as predicted. Knowing that you are not yet close enough to the mine, and that your spot in the rocks does not give you the best protection, as the jetbike speeds past you make a run for a gully another twenty meters away.\n\nYou sprint for all you are worth and manage to leap just as the Death Bladez blade swings through where you were not even a second before. He really guns the engines to try and get you and massively overshoots the gully as the mine silently detonates. The jetbike, now almost at full speed, loses its repulsers and descends downwards.\n\nThe bike hits the ground at over one-hundred fifty kilometres per hour and rolls to a thunderous crash. You can’t tell if he bailed out but if he stayed on the thing you’re sure he’s going to die; if he jumped out you doubt he’s fairing much better.

You find the bedsheets drenched, and you are in a state of euphoria as you move around the apartment, as you come to your senses more it is apparent that you are sexually aroused, the heat in your loins is intense and you stop yourself from touching yourself. Part of you is screaming that you are becoming the dream, that you want the dream, but it is just a small part of you now. Nearly a memory of someone you used to me. \n\nYou let the thoughts slide away to your single-minded focus, to get Jane and yourself off the planet, but then what? The dream it felt so nice?\n\n[[Back to the mission|Apartment]]&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Dream to 4&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="RTG1.1" tags="" created="201608161139" modifier="twee" twine-position="150,5330">You find yourself dropped off near a solitary podium in middle of the desert. During the flight you were told to wait on the podium until you are given further instructions once your fellow contestants are in place. Luckily for you, you are one of the last to be dropped off so you don’t have to wait for long. Your only company is a camera drone that hovers high above you in the sky.\n\nOn the podium is a small backpack with a number of water bottles to help keep you hydrated. To add to the drama, the show leaves it up to the contestants to decide how many to carry and lets you all know that one bottle is laced with a concoction that will make most violently ill. In the distance you can see the city outskirts, still a good six hour’s march away if you keep a steady pace. It will probably take an hour or two longer if you go out of your way to avoid being seen. Two of the EMP mines you planted are fairly close to your location and idle away the time weighing the pros and cons of the routes.\n\nYour thoughts are disrupted when a speaker in the podium’s base crackle into life and announce the fifth Evindium contest and begins to showcase the various contestants. When your turn comes, you raise a hand to victory as Contestant Number 8 and provide an amused smile for the cameras. You can just imagine this is the first time Charles has seen you since you joined the show and you wonder if he will recognise you straight away or have to think about it. Either way, even if he finds out, he is going to have a dilemma on his plate since he can’t tell his colleagues that a high class escort he hired is now participating on the show; there would be too many questions and implications he was just trying to have you killed. \n\nIt is then announced that all contestants are to cross the desert to the highlighted building in the distance. The hunter is not allowed within one mile of the building and all contestants must complete the course within eight hrs. The sunlight is beaming down on everyone and you measured the distance at eighteen miles when you were doing your recon earlier. You briefly consider the fact that all ten contestants could very well die from the heat alone this round. All contestants have an hour to get away from their podiums and cover some ground before the hunter is released.\n\n[[Let the games begin|RTG1.2]]</div><div tiddler="Random SQ2.1" tags="" created="201603090109" modifier="twee" twine-position="5750,2530">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $RSQ2 is 0&gt;&gt;&quot;Actually, I'm on my way to meet a date.

Clarice tells me the footage for the show is already our most watched show ever. That finale had ratings we could have only dreamed of,&quot; he says, laying on the praise. &quot;However, I didn’t keep you behind just to pat your back.\n\n&quot;You see, I may mainly be the Director of Filming for the show, but I’m also a good friend with the Head of Security and I know they have put five people down as the source of the leak, I’m on that list&quot; says Bertram pausing for effect.\n\nYou nod for him to go on, not going to answer anything.\n\n&quot;Now the thing is they will eventually find out that all three of us spent an evening with you and I will have an uncomfortable time, and the thing is I know you got your information from either Clarice or Charles, either a backhand deal or you fucked them over good&quot;. \n\n&quot;Now, I’m not sure why Charles wants to meet with you, but I will tell you that things will be a lot easier for everyone if you leave that room with someone to blame,&quot; he says before sliding you a concealable pistol and a tamper proof voice recorder. &quot;I don’t care what happens, just get a confession or some sort of evidence for me to give them and everything will work its way out.&quot;\n\n&quot;I’m not here to do your dirty work, why the pistol&quot; you say as you walk past him towards the lift.\n\n&quot;And no-one says you have to do anything dirty, but if the Head of Security does not get the evidence once he has finished with us five, they will come looking for you&quot; he calls back nonchalantly.\n\n&quot;What is the pistol for?&quot; you ask, trying to probe his intentions. \n\n&quot;Intimidation, I can't think of anything else to do with a gun&quot;..... comes the reply.\n\nYou know that a show like this will want to eliminate a leak and ensure security is improved so the same thing does not happen again. You know it could be in your interests to supply the information Bertram asked for. \n\n[[Meet with Charles and Clarice|RTG5.1]]\n</div><div tiddler="RTG4" tags="" created="201608190333" modifier="twee" twine-position="10,5470">On the way to the final location, the show informs &lt;&lt;if $Contestants is 1&gt;&gt;you that you will&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;everyone that they will&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; have to try and ascend a tower guarded by the Masked Mamba, better known to you as Mark. &lt;&lt;if $Contestants gte 3&gt;&gt;The show has you go last, no doubt hoping your death will prove for a great finale and a final spike in viewership. From your point of view this is great; he’ll tire himself out stalking so many other contestants as they attempt to climb the building.&lt;&lt;elseif $Contestands is 2&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You’re told you’ll be one of the last contestant to go but wonder if it will do much for your overall advantage. The more you think about it, a couple of extra survivors would have helped you tire him out quite a bit before your attempt, but there isn’t much you can do now.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Since you are the only survivor left, you know your only real advantage in this round is going to be the tracker that you managed to plant in Mark's ass.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\n\nBefore you face the ninja, there is the final interview scheduled for any remaining contestants that have gotten this far. Yours, however, has the addition of an extra off camera event when Charles gets a flunky to take you into a side room to have a word with him and a bodyguard. You nod at him and grin, curious to see what he has to say.\n\n&quot;I know you must be a plant of some sort and victory is nearly in your grasp but let me tell you that you clearly that you have no chance in this next event. We have made some last second changes to the building so any information you may have is worthless. Our last hunter is also a close combat killing machine and I’m going to enjoy watching him skewer you with his sword,&quot; he rants on while you remain silent. &quot;I asked him to make sure that he finishes you off by impaling you through your pussy like the little cunt you are. It'll still probably be quicker than you deserve.&quot;\n\n&quot;You’re fucked up in the head, Charles. You’re just a little man with a little dick who likes to lord it up over women he's convinced he's so superior to. Did you really bring me here just to try and intimidate me?&quot; you ask casually, knowing how non-chalante you are will wound his pride. \n\nCharles struggles with his words before finally getting to the point. He will personally pay you an extra one-hundred credits if you’re willing to help him implicate Clarice. He tells you that his boss and other executives realize this may have been a setup of some nature&lt;&lt;if $Hunters is 1&gt;&gt;, especially after every hunter has ended up dead so far&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $Contestants gte 6&gt;&gt; and more contestants have survived until the final round than ever before&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;. Opinions of how this show has turned out this way and what to do about it are mixed but they all seem to agree that you are tied to today’s events.\n\nSome want to offer you a job in response to this and Clarice has told everyone that ratings are at record highs which should help ease any investors nervous about you being brought on board. Detractors of it being a setup wonder if this all just an extraordinary series of events and worry that pinning it on a single contestant would be a PR nightmare if it can’t be proven. Either way, there is an ongoing hunt for a leak, and he thinks Clarice has reached the end of her usefulness to him. She's been a good fuck but has also been getting ahead of herself and he already has a more agreeable replacement in mind. \n\nYou agree to his plan in order to placate him. You try and reassure yourself this is a good idea; he might even encourage the ninja to fail to find you to stir up the senior management and further and guarantee somebody would be on the way out. If Charles doesn’t, he runs the risk of management blaming him, but dead people don’t talk either so you hope this was the best choice for now. \n\nThe show must go on and Charles can’t hold you up so you head off to your regularly scheduled interview with none other than Clarice. She talks up your expert handling of the hunters up until this point and asks you if you’d ever think about becoming one yourself. You tease it might not be such a bad idea and she lets you know that the fans would love it if you gave it some serious consideration. The final round sufficiently hyped up, your interview concludes and you are lined up with the other remaining $Contestants contestants to march to the final building.\n\n&lt;&lt;if $Contastants lte 2&gt;&gt;[[You have a feeling this is going to be a rough one|RTG4A]]&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;[[You feel bad for the doomed souls in front of you|RTG4B]]&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Intel 1 Start" tags="" created="201510281026" modifier="twee" twine-position="4070,2810">&lt;h3&gt;Somewhere in Evindium City&lt;/h3&gt;You are sitting in a taxi headed to a meeting with this Mr. Grayson. Your thoughts are preoccupied with how you are going to manage to get the money to either smuggle Jane off-planet or to get the Magnum repaired on the black market. Infiltration missions, although lucrative, are the least likely option as they normally required weeks to months of planning to set up; precious time that you do not have.\n\nThe taxi pulls up in front of a nondescript office building. You pay the driver your fair and step out. You enter the building and find the first floor to be a set of private meeting rooms. You soon find room number twenty as instructed.

Please, take a seat,&quot; he says as he stands up and offers you a chair. Mr. Grayson is a balding, middle-aged; the executive type you figure.\n\n&quot;Thank you, Mr. Grayson. Is it safe to talk here?&quot; you ask as you sit down.\n\n&quot;The owner is a friend of mine and assures me that the place is swept for bugs regularly. I also carry a few devices of my own to make sure no-one listens in,&quot; he says with a proud smile. &quot;Before you ask, the corporations are quite open to private meeting places. Competition is fierce and these kind of places facilitate their clandestine 'this never happened' meetings. Similar our own, I suppose,&quot; he says with a smile.\n\nYou summarize your current position to Mr. Grayson who listens intently without giving away any indications of how he may feel on the matter.\n\n&quot;I know the Xena Corporation wants you badly, Celeste. They have been in contact with me through one of my intermediaries. However, the ones you need to worry about the most are the Evictor Mercenaries. Those animals made the mistake of promising that nobody can escape their security alive. Your escape from their failed trap made them lose face in front of the Xena Corporation and now they specifically have their sights on you.&quot;\n\n&quot;You seem to be very well informed,&quot; you say with a grimace. You didn’t expect to encounter someone so well connected.\n\n&quot;Oh, don't worry,&quot; Mr. Grayson says as he raises his hands. &quot;I'm not going to sell you out, Celeste. Sure, I'd make a tidy sum, but reputation is at times much more valuable than money. I pride myself on my reputation and capability to honor my deals and I promised Sid that I'd tell you what you need.&quot;\n\nStill not overly sure about Mr. Grayson, you give him a nod and he continues. \n\n&quot;First of all, you are going to need a lot of money and someone important who owes you a favour in order to get your ship fixed on the black market. You will also need to arrange for a new ID for your colleague. \n\nIf you hope to get everything as fast as possible, it will mean that people are going to have to want to take a gamble on you. You need to get the interest of those people and find a way into their favour. I'm going to pull few strings and get you involved with the seedy criminal underworld of Evindium. The rest is up to you, Celeste.&quot;\n\n[[Consider Grayson's Offer|Intel1.1]]</div><div tiddler="STAT CHANGE SCORES" tags="" created="201511222132" modifier="twee" twine-position="7710,3090">Training - 0.5 Exhibitionism   1 Offering a shag\n             2 BDSM Device     3 Dildo Show\n\n\nSCX So Awesome!

I bet you could retire now as a millionaire or become some huge executive’s personal bodyguard,&quot; Hugo says with an impressed look on his face.\n\n&quot;Just get focused now,&quot; you respond. &quot;Jane, fire up the engines and get hangar control’s clearance for local flight. Let’s get this show on the road.&quot;\n\n&quot;Hugo is asking too many questions and being a bit too chatty for a normal merc, don't you think?&quot; you ask Jane over a private channel.\n\n&quot;Agreed. I’ll make sure to watch my back,&quot; Jane replies over her own implant. &quot;Should we just ditch him over the wastes somewhere to be safe?&quot;\n\n&quot;No. I’m not prepared to kill a man on a hunch,&quot; you admit.\n\n&quot;I don’t think he’s figured out that I’ve got an implant as well,&quot; Jane says while making eye contact with you.\n\n&quot;You’re probably right,&quot; you say, holding her gaze. &quot;I think he’s written you off as a pilot for hire. He doesn’t see us a team and we can use that to our advantage if necessary.

Occasionally, a stray hand will come try and pinch your ass but it is generally a civil environment. If it was not for a girl chained to a wooden horse in the centre of the room, it would look like any other private club for the wealthy. The notice that the girl is gagged, probably to stop any high pitched squeals as she does not look comfortable at all.\n\nAbout halfway through your shift, you are approached by the Club Manager, a Shebo director that you have seen, but not really spoken to. During your bland conversation with the man the question of hostess affiliation comes up. You have only one real choice in your mind and you tell him straight that you would like to be an independent hostess. This statement causes a pause and the man regards you with a curious expression.\n\n&quot;Why would you want to do that, Celeste? There would be a lot less money in it. You know this is unconventional as most hostesses affiliate within their first few shifts, most even on their first,&quot; explains the man.\n\n&quot;I set the throne record and am the best hostess for any group or Corporation and that I would provide an unfair advantage for them. I also have found out after talking to other hostesses that affiliation means nearly full-time work; something I won't, and more importantly can’t, do,&quot; you answer, prepared for his proposition. \n\nThe Shebo Director takes this in, laughs, and tells you that he will consult with the other members and the management team. He leaves with a wink and tells you that he will have an answer for you soon.\n\nYou know that there has been a lot of interest to get you affiliated so that the lucky group can have the best mascot; a bunch of idiots, the lot of them. What unsettles you a little bit is the ease in which your proposal was accepted without question. After a couple more hours working, you get your answer proposed position was approve, but like all things there is a catch.\n\n[[There is always a catch|Shebo2.1]]</div><div tiddler="SC12.3" tags="" created="201601160201" modifier="twee" twine-position="7850,710">//Celeste is on a path to discovering just how true that theory may be.//\n\nYour ''Submission'' has increased by 3%.\n\nSid watched recordings, both fascinated and scared...

The open door just makes it seem more likely you do have an audience and, thinking of them watching, you dig your fingernails into your breasts like talons. You put as much weight on your clit as you can and rock your hips forwards and back again. \n\nYour body begins to shake as you experience an awesome, pain-fueled orgasm that leaves you whimpering, sweat-soaked, and drained as your juices puddle below you. You float in a blissful afterglow but are anchored to reality by the agonizing pain of sharp metal digging into your abused and hyper-sensitive clit.\n\nThe door that beeped has locked again and the locker where you put your clothes has unlocked. It doesn't matter right now since you can't move your legs to get to either of them. You sit back, taking the weight off your clit and onto your butt-cheeks, and close your eyes to slowly catch your breath.\n\nEventually, you find the strength to get up and stumble across to the locker to retrieve your things. You don't have the balance to get dressed standing up, though, and have to sit back down on the bench where you just put on your depraved, masochistic show. \n\nYou see specks of blood around the raised edges of some of the holes and feel all your fresh wounds tingle in response. It hurts a lot more this time than before, but you just can't get into your gear without sitting down. You even consider just going outside naked where you could dress on the steps.\n\nGetting up again, wincing, you move to the concrete steps to put on your footwear. You should have thought of this sooner while your mind was fuzzy with afterglow.

The complex is made of two power plants, a research lab hosting a central computer core and a couple of office along with an administrative building.&quot; \n\nYou zoom into reveal an aerial view of the complex as you continue.\n\n&quot;From what I saw, the security is tight overall and tightest within the lab.&quot; You pause to catch your breath. &quot;The mission is to acquire a data core containing a copy of the lab computer's data. It is supposed to have been hidden in the control room of Reactor One by an inside agent. Getting the core out of the complex with the agent was considered too risky, so it was placed in a less secure area to be extracted. The identity of the agent was not revealed to us and we are to have no contact with them.&quot;\n\nYou raise your gaze from the screen to look at Jane and Hugo to make sure they are following what you are talking about. After a brief moment, you continue to outline the rest of the mission.\n\n&quot;The crux of our mission is that Reactor One is offline for maintenance, opening a route in through the coolant system pipes located here,&quot; you say and point to the screen.\n\n&quot;The customer has supplied us with the maintenance access codes for the sealed gates inside the reactor. The mission will take place during the night shift and needs to end before the day shift comes on. Because of the circumstances, a stealth air evacuation will be necessary. I have chosen this small balcony on the south side of the reactor as the optimal exfiltration point.&quot;\n\nYou highlight a part of the reactor building.\n\n&quot;I’ll disable the surveillance cameras so they won't see us but you //will// trigger an alarm when you enter the complex’s no fly zone. Once you pick me up, we’ll fly into one of the commercial lanes and hide amongst the traffic before we drop below radar and make our way across the sand sea.\n\n&quot;Hugo, you’ll be providing fire support in case things get hairy. Get armored up and be ready to take on drones or security personnel. After the exfiltration, you will help guard the data core until we get it off planet. That’s it for the mission briefing.

Clarice was a new media relations assistant and messed up a piece, Charles offered to speak up for her in return for information on her boss. \n\nClarice at the start enjoyed knowing that Charles had got one up on her boss and continued helping Charles along. Promotion came for Charles and the same for Clarice until Clarice found herself being blackmailed by Charles. While Clarice was no innocent, or so Charles tells you he took great joy in telling Clarice that she needed to hitch up her skirt, drop her panties, bend over Charles desk and ask to be fucked in the ass. \n\nAt that moment Clarice joins in saying that it was the worst moment in her career, knowing that if she did not comply well she would lose her job, if she did comply she might keep her job. The decision was made and Charles enjoyed power over Clarice to this day.  They worked well together and Clarice got even by getting the Director of Media post against Charles wishes. Charles interjects that even though Clarice has got a big flashy role she still is the one sucking his dick, Charles like to make sure you know that going down on Clarice, or giving her orgasms is of no concern to him. \n\nWhile this is all entertaining you need to think who you will setup for the leak, Clarice or Charles, or even both as they seem to deserve each other. Though Charles is by far the biggest dick of the pair of them you trust him to keep his word.

Charles goes silent and with the gun still pointing at him you continue.\n\n“Charles you said we should do a three way split and then blame Clarice in setting you up, the conniving power hungry bitch was out to get one step higher in the corporate ladder, or not owe you when you gave her leg up, for a leg over”. \n\n“Didn’t you Charles?”\n\nCharles pulls a measure of courage and tells you that he will not play your little games and shoot him if you want. You tell Clarice that clearly now that Charles does not want to do the deal then she should shoot him. Clarice agrees with you and you hand over the gun.\n\nCharles starts pleading for his life, saying he was involved in a three way split, that it was his idea and that he planned on Clarice getting killed. This is plenty for your voice recorder and you nod at Clarice. Clarice shoots Charles until the magazine is empty, missing a couple of times in her excitement and failing to kill Charles until about the fourth bullet. When the gun does not fire Clarice comes down from her aggressive moment\n\n“Oh god, what have I done” comes out an anguished squeal.\n\nYou tell her that you recorded Charles’s confession and that Clarice should say that she was blackmailed by Charles and was clearly being setup as the fall guy.

There is only one choice for you and that is soon as you are out of view you hop in a taxi with one-way glass windows.\n\nAs your ride drives away you spot Hugo, looking around, for a second you wonder if he can see you through the glass as he pays the taxi a lot of attention, but the vehicle is moving too fast for him to catch up with if he tried. But your heart is still pounding, what if he has a vehicle of his own? Nearby even. After 5 minutes of sitting in the taxi you come to the conclusion that you are not being followed and as you return to your apartment you contemplate options, do you have enough time to find and take out Hugo, or can you get off this rock first?\n\n[[Return to Apartment|Apartment]]\n&lt;&lt;set $Event to 6&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Intel23.10" tags="" created="201705082229" modifier="twee" twine-position="4910,6450">&lt;img src=data/cw12.png&gt;\n\nThe metallic face looks down at you, and you scrabble away into a corner.

She has a reputation of being one of the best [[infiltrators]] around within this circle of business.\n\nCeleste’s military history ensures that she is skilled at standard combat operations but was known best for maintaining icy calm nerves under all situations.

The other problem is you reckon that you will be recognised and sure enough when you arrive the bouncers usher you into the VIP zone. \n\nAs you move into the area people come up to congratulate you on the bits where you did well, saying that they think you have potential and asking when you are going to fight again. One promoter takes you under his wing and explains that sometimes the losers are really popular, especially those that take the ‘punishment’ so well.

The odds will not be in your favour like this again so you wonder why you have returned.

Both fighters and those who bet and lost on you winning. &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n\nAs you move into the area people come up to congratulate you on the bits where you did well, saying that they think you have potential and asking when you are going to fight again.

You wonder to yourself would you want that, to lose and the publically give yourself to the victor? To be humiliated and then taken like a piece of meat. &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;especially those that take the ‘punishment’ so well. You feign a smile but inside are boiling both with the humiliation that you lost, but perhaps with the knowing that you enjoyed it, and everyone saw you enjoying it.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n\nThe promoter breaks off in mid conversation as the sight of Rock Lobster heading directly towards you gives him a moment to consider, he decides to retreat and passes over his card muttering for you to call him as he disappears. The Rock gives you a smile and askes if you will join him on his table, you agree, the company may be good and you came here for something……\n\n&lt;&lt;if $CF7D is 1&gt;&gt;It is odd you think that you have readily accepted an offer of a drink from a man, whom you don’t personally know, but have been very intimate with. The thought of the Rock pile driving your asshole is fresh in your mind as he flirts with you. Things have definitely happened in the wrong order here and you recall his parting words about becoming his groupie. &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;While you have sparred with many a man in the marines it was rare that you would beat someone who was actually better than you, fighters make their own luck, but lady luck was with you that night. It would seem that Rock Lobster does not bear any ill feelings from the night, is he flirting with you?&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n\nRock Lobster keeps the conversation light hearted and stays away from talking about the fight. But he has a reason you know it, the envious stares you are getting from the eager looking women in the VIP bar says that the Rock Lobster is a catch many want. Rock catches your gaze and casually admits that pussy is easy for him to get. You resist saying that you might be hard to get and instead say that maybe you might pick a man out there, or maybe a woman, giving him a provocative stare saying that maybe you bat for the other side. \n\nRock does not call you out but instead orders more drinks and you can feel yourself becoming a little bit tipsy. You said to yourself that there is no way that you will get drunk and told Rock the same, but you have the feeling he is trying to loosen you up. The conversation soon turns to the main topic and Rock’s true agenda comes out.\n\n&lt;&lt;if $CF7D is 1&gt;&gt;Rock simply asks you whether you enjoyed losing to him, as your face shows first surprise and then indignation he continues by saying that you were very relaxed. As you are unsure whether to laugh, throw your drink at him or try and smash his face in he makes a joke out of it, saying whether you practice mediation or not. The joke being how relaxed your butt hole was when he slid right into it. Rock then continues saying that he knows you orgasmed and he reckons it was twice at least, he reckons you liked it and are back for more. \n\n[[Rock owns the conversation|CH3.1]]\n&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Rock admits that he has had a question in his head for so long, after you won why you did not abuse him as per your right. You stop and think about it and recall the fight, the simple answer was that you were totally warn out and elated over winning. You really thought that you were going down in that fight, not that you were going to throw in the towel. But the thought of grinding your pussy into a defeated Rock Lobster sounds good, but the whole of thought of a caveman style sex session, defeated, lying there and being taken sounds good as well. You decide to say:\n\n[[You were too worn out to reap your rewards|CH3.2]]\n\n[[Because you would have rather been ravished|CH3.1]]&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n</div><div tiddler="CH4" tags="" created="201506292009" modifier="twee" twine-position="990,2250">&lt;&lt;if $Days &gt;= $CHTimer&gt;&gt; Out of pure curiosity you rang the promoter that gave you his card, you told him that you were not planning to come back to fighting unless the purse was high. A little lie really as you have no plans to do so, the money is just too low to get you off-planet and the betting odds will be a lot more balanced.\n\nHowever he does suggest a 40 credit deal for a fight at the Cock and Hen, this is for a re-match with the wrestler but there is a difference. This time only wrestling will be allowed and you will be covered in baby oil to give you a chance of victory. You are allowed sports underwear or a bikini and the funds will be paid for winning or losing. If you lose there will be a forfeit with the expected results, a 10 minute defeat and humiliation session. You know how it will turn out, it will be a live fucking in front of a crowd.  You almost say to the promoter that who does he think you are, but truth be told you have been in that line of work, but this must be the novelty end of the matches? \n\nThe promoter tells you that you are one of the best looking girls in the game, and you will get lots of match offers with good pay if you offer yourself to the victor. He tells you about how much you could make which would be good earnings for an everyday person, you are not though. The work you are in has made you a millionaire and you feign interest in the whole thing. To give you more of a chance it is agreed that you will have ‘lives’, the first submission from you will involve a layer of clothing being stripped away, then you will start again. This will basically give you two lives, for top and bottom and losing while naked will trigger a public fucking. \n\nClearly this is designed to humiliate you and essentially be a porn show as you try and slip out of the wrestlers embrace covered in baby oil. No serious fighter would probably do it and you can’t bring yourself to talk to Jane about it. 40 credits is small pickings in the bigger picture, but here and in this situation it could come in handy. Losing is not guaranteed either but you are unsure if you want to carry on in this sordid game of ‘fighting’.\n\nDo you do it?\n\n[[Yes|CH4.1]]\n[[No, return to your apartment|Apartment]]\n&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Nothing is going on, come back another day. \n\n&lt;&lt;back&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n</div><div tiddler="CH5" tags="" created="201506292009" modifier="twee" twine-position="1130,2250">You get close to the door, and people recognise you and start to gossip.

Once the ship landed Jane and you sit down for a chat.\n\n&quot;We have two major problems: our ship has taken heavy damage and your face is plastered on every newscast on this planet,&quot; you tell her curtly. &quot;We can't take the ship to any repair yard as they would report the obvious gunfire damage to the planetary authorities. This of course is separate from the fact that if what Hugo said was right we can't get you off the planet that easily either.&quot;\n\nJane nods in agreement.\n\n&quot;Those are two big problems all right. Hugo was correct. I just ran a search on the planetary net and confirmed that I'm on the wanted list. Even if they don't have my retina scans or personal data, I reckon that a facial recognition system would pick me up in no time. If I get caught they'll have my visa details and will know you associate with me as well. Let’s face it,&quot; Jane laments with a heavy sigh, &quot;I’m pretty screwed here at the moment. I never thought I would get trapped somewhere... Always figured it would be a missile that ended me while I was seated inside a cockpit.&quot;\n\nPlacing your hand on Jane’s knee, you say, &quot;Data can be changed and smuggling is always an option. There are also other avenues out there like the black market. We just have to find and connect with them.&quot;\n\nJane lets out a deep breath and leans back in her chair.\n\n&quot;I know,&quot; she starts, &quot;but you are no hacker and I need to accept I'm going to be stuck in this area. We have little money on planet and they will be looking for us... No, looking for me. How long do you think we actually have until the ship is found?&quot;\n\n&quot;The good thing for us is that the corporations don't invest heavily into their investigation departments, just paramilitary security forces and some limited corporate investigations team,&quot; you say in an attempt to reassure Jane. &quot;Everything else is privately owned and the corporation won't trust anyone else with a matter like this. Besides, once the data is off the planet there will be nothing to gain for the corporation by coming after us is except for personal revenge. Fortunately for us, revenge doesn't help their bottom line. Regardless, I think it’s about time I go call Sid and explain the situation to him. I’m sure he’ll know a way out of this.&quot;\n\n[[Go check in with Sid|Mission1.5A]]</div><div tiddler="Mission1.4" tags="" created="201409240634" modifier="twee" twine-position="2950,10">&lt;h3&gt;Twenty minutes later&lt;/h3&gt;After unbuckling from your seat, you move towards to the cockpit entrance while Hugo remained standing by the rear hatch.\n\n&quot;No signs of any pursuers. I’m taking us down and doubling back over the great desert basin,&quot; Jane reports from the pilot’s seat. &quot;Thank god the planet has poor radar coverage.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah, corporations don’t like to spend money where there is no financial gain,&quot; you reply with a grim smile. &quot;Though the Xena Corporation may want to reconsider their position on that after this. Jane, how serious is the damage?&quot;\n\n&quot;Not looking good,&quot; she says, clearly concerned. &quot;We have two small hull breaches, so planetary orbit or even high altitude flight is off the table. You may have noticed that we are losing cabin pressure by the second.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah, I thought it felt a bit drafty in here. We are lucky that the breaches are at the aft section,&quot; you admit.\n\n&quot;Lucky or not,&quot; Jane says, swinging around in her seat to face you, &quot;as long as we are exposed to the atmosphere, a space jump will rupture the hull. Not that we would even get past the Jumpgate Customs with a shot up ship anyway.&quot;\n\n&quot;OK,&quot; you say with a sigh. &quot;So we need to get a repairs taken care of off the record. I suspect that Xena will be watching all the registered shipyards for any reports.&quot;\n\n&quot;That’s not your only problem,&quot; Hugo interrupts. &quot;There is a warrant for a female matching Jane’s description on the planetary web. She should’ve worn a fucking helmet. They got your mug shot from the Skybot’s video feed and will be searching for you.&quot;\n\n&quot;Jane,&quot; Celeste interjected. &quot;It’ll be alright. Just keep a low profile for a while and I will figure out a way past this.&quot;\n\n&quot;There are lots of checkpoints around Evindium,&quot; Hugo explains bluntly. &quot;She will be restricted to the hangar and the few surrounding complexes. It also won’t be possible for her to use the metro system without getting flagged.&quot;\n\n&quot;I’m well aware of this,&quot; you reply with a hint of irritation in your voice. &quot;I’ll contact Sid when we land and tell him we’ve got the data core. We are going to need help getting off this planet.&quot;\n\nHugo raised the barrel of his rifle and points it squarely at your chest. \n\n&quot;I’m afraid you’ll need more help than that,&quot; he says with a smirk. &quot;You see, I’m not actually working for Sid. I'm not really much of what you’d call a team player, either. That data core; give it to me. ''Now''!&quot; he demands as he drops his smirk.\n\nYou hold his gaze, completely unfazed by his threats. \n\n&quot;It doesn't have to end this way,&quot; you stated calmly. &quot;Just forget the mission and we’ll drop you off at the city limits. Quit while you’re still ahead, Hugo.&quot;\n\nJane, fully aware of the situation, concentrates on flying the ship.\n\n&quot;Not a fucking chance!&quot; Hugo’s voice booms throughout the ship as his finger tightens on the trigger. &quot;Give me the data core or I’ll shoot you limb by limb. The only reason you’re still breathing is that the data core doesn’t react well to bullets, especially not high-velocity, armour-piercing ones like the ones I’m packing.&quot;\n\nYou slowly raise your hands while you signal Jane. Suddenly, the ship goes into a vertical ascent, throwing both you and Hugo to the back of the ship. You wedge yourself into an alcove in preparation and hang on for dear life. Jane mashes the cargo door controls in the cockpit and Hugo, pinned down by the weight of his armour and the force of the acceleration, realizes that he’ll soon be dumped into the desert below.\n\n&quot;You psychotic cunt.

You smile and chuckle to yourself at the pun. Tonight you have dressed the part with an open back clubbing dress which shows off your legs. This is complimented by a pair of strappy, leather high heels that further emphasize your figure. Your ensemble is capped of with pair of skimpy, lace black panties complete the outfit. When you arrive Shaun is waiting for you outside Ruck's Pool Bar and greets you with a quick kiss on the lips. \n\n&quot;Wow Celeste, you look hot tonight,&quot; he says as you notice him wince, &quot;Let me introduce you to the boys.&quot; With that Shaun turns and gently places his hand on your lower back to guide you. He pulls you in closer slightly and then pulls away. You look at him with an amused smile; Carla's training is making him uncertain. You’re sure Carla is the one who put him up to all of this. 'Boys' is the other thing that caught your attention as this is a date with Shaun's mates apparently as well. Are they hoping that you’re going to teach all of them? While it sounds slightly pleasant, you have yet to have a drink and you aren’t really sure you’d have time for all of that... although it does sound fun.\n\nYou certainly have your decision laid out for you and you also need to consider that one of Shaun's mates might be able to arrange to have your ship repaired. You have looked up the company Shaun works for and Mack's Ship Repair Yard would be able to accommodate the Magnum. You also have find out that the Yard is owned by Shaun's godfather;  godfather who has no children of his own. Tonight you think you might just pretend to get a little drunk... or maybe you will just get drunk!

You sip your drink and explain that even if you're confident you could take their credits; you still aren't interested in risking your own. You tell him you don't play much and maybe he should agree to a handicap. \n\nHe simply smiles and lets you know that is ok so long as you are willing to offer an alternative payment if you lose before looking you up and down. You know his type and assume his friends will be just as sleazy, and easy to manipulate as he seemingly is, so you agree. Your only condition is there is no way you'll have sex with anyone who manages to best you if a credit is all that is on the line.

It is a small octogon shaped room with only the titular 'throne' in the centre. This throne is not at all like you had pictured; you imagined a large, plush chair, maybe with some kind of bondage contraption attached below. \n\nYou are instead greeted by the sight of a bulky, golden metal device shaped like a medieval throne but missing the seat. There are wrist and foot restraints along with two bars which rest where one would normally have sat. You can see that anyone could support themselves on the throne by using their legs and arms to push back against it. This would be a physically stressful position but the scariest part of this bondage apparatus was a fishing hook dangling between the bars. \n\nThe cruel intention behind the throne suddenly becomes clear: Standing up is impossible due to its design and the angled foot restraints. The best you could do is hold a half squat while heavily straining the muscles in your legs, feet, and arms. If you can't hold your weight up under the stress then your body will begin sag onto the hook.\n\nThis would be the best option if it wasn't for the weight attached to it. The fishing hook is clearly meant to be inserted inside your pussy, and if you sink down in the frame, the weight is lifted and the hook will dig deep into your sex. The image of this in your mind makes you cringe.\n\nSeeing the fear in your eyes the director snickers and then speaks. &quot;I see from the look on your face that you know what is going to happen to you next. Of course, you can always back out but if you are serious about this then you can strip off and our hostess here, Caroline, will help you get hooked in.&quot; \n\nYou know that backing out is not an option and try to steady your nerves before submitting your body for the sadistic challenge. It occurs to you that you haven’t asked an extremely important question. \n\n&quot;How long am I supposed to stay on that thing?&quot; you nervously inquire.\n\n&quot;It is an endurance challenge meant to impress us. For a girl with little physical fitness, they will only last one or two minutes before the stress on her legs and arms will cause her muscles to fail. After a couple of frantic ups and downs on the hook, we will then let her down,&quot; he says with a gleam to his eye. &quot;This is only because after a short while the screaming, moaning, and shouting will get to be too much; we are not here to torture people, after all. This is meant purely to ensure that we only hire the girls with the right skills for the line of work we offer.\n\n&quot;Now, you on the other hand are an intriguing specimen who is in great shape. I will be candid with you and admit some are even hoping that you will be able to set a new record time. So, in short, my dear, the answer to your question is this will last as long as you can.&quot; \n\nHow typical, you think to yourself. Of course there wouldn’t be a limit. You only wonder if you’ll scream out first in pleasure or in pain.\n\n&quot;Right. I'll strip and get on, but can you promise this thing won't tear my pussy?&quot; you ask. You want to know if your poor slit will be usable again after the abuse.\n\n&quot;The weight is not heavy enough to cause the skinto tear but it will allow you to experience a fair degree of pain as it digs into your skin. You //will// be bruised for weeks, but we generously provide free treatment with the best equipment around.

It may look decrepit, but we actually purchased it quite cheap from a small gang of drug runners on the condition they still be allowed to operate out of here. Now, you will notice they’ve been generous enough to lock and section off the areas where they’re working, so if you’re smart, I’d encourage you not to try and force any doors.\n\n&quot;You will each have a chance to ascend the tower in the order you led here and the remaining contestants aren’t allowed to interfere. On the roof is a button that will set off this speaker system, ending your round and securing your victory. If, somehow, more than one of you is able to best our deadliest hunter, the Masked Mamba, then you will split the pot with the other winners.\n\n&quot;Once you enter the lobby, you will notice that we have generously provided you with a choice of close quarter weapons to defend yourselves with. Should you actually manage to kill the Masked Mamba, there will be an additional two-hundred and fifty credits added to the pool and no remaining contestants will be allowed to try and ascend the tower. Now, if our first contestant would please step forward, I wish you the best of luck,&quot; he finishes with a grin and the TV screens go blank.\n\n[[And so it begins|RTG4B1]]</div><div tiddler="SC44" tags="" created="201602072201" modifier="twee" twine-position="7570,1550">//In the past, women have been taken with horseriding for the constant thump of the saddle that comes with each stride forward when you are sat at the right angle.

You quickly kneel down in front of him then look up into his eyes and say, &quot;It must be your lucky day today, Craig.&quot; He smiles down at you. You waste no time unzipping his pants and getting his rock hard cock out. Within seconds your head is bobbing up and down giving Craig a good time.\n \n&lt;img src=data/rpool6.png&gt;\n\nYou soon notice Craig has a flushed expression which flushes even more when you hear Carla's voice. Craig points down and you hear Carla snort and then see her shadow as she steps behind you. You break off from Craig's cock and turn round to face Carla. As you open your mouth to explain, Carla places a finger on your lips. She smiles at you and says, &quot;Ah, ah, ah! I believe someone is missing that mouth of yours. It would be rude not to finish what you’ve started.&quot;\n\nWith that you turn around and get back to work on Craig's cock. As you carry on sucking Craig off on your knees, you hear Carla kicks off her shoes. You hear the table creak as she places her weight on the pool table for balance and inserts her foot between your legs.\n\n&lt;img src=data/rpool7.png&gt;\n\nUsing the top of her foot, she starts to rub up on and against your panties.

With your juices off of his fingers, Craig asks if maybe you could pick things up later at least.\n\nTo break the tension you offer to play him in another game of pool and he accepts.

The shop also contains a broad range of sex toys and your eyes are drawn to a large, fist shaped dildo which is the centre item of the dildo display.\n\nThe famous part of the shop and what drew you in is the automatic photo booth by the changing rooms. For a small fee there are a number of items that can be tried on and a mini video taken. This video is then displayed outside the front of the shop and, if good enough, replayed throughout the Red Light District. Sometimes the video even follows the person around the Red Light District like a piece of advertising. There are even some windows next to the photo booth, next to a quiet alley but the videos can bring people round.\n\nThis can be a good or bad thing when your image is flashed up behind you and people stop and stare. Red Light workers are not allowed to do this even though it is human nature. Due to nudity being a common occurrence in the Red Light District, people will often be more interested in whether or not a ‘normal’ person or district visitor will flaunt their flesh --- knowing full well that anyone could see the images. \n\nYou find it the thought of walking around where an image could pop up with you in some sexy lingerie quite appealing.

People are bound to comment on the place, especially if this ‘M’ is trying to get people to take hallucinogenic drugs. It turns out there is little, but a man now deceased said his girlfriend became infatuated with the owner and that she was brainwashed.  Though friends of the man agreed with the changes in the girl, the man was considered to be deranged as he jumped off a skyscraper shouting for people to save him. This was after a last-minute showdown at Fantasy Wear where his girlfriend categorically stated that she did not want to be with him. \n\nWhile you are in the area you decide to look around, a quick recon of the place, a shop in a secure part of Downtown.  What you find is good, but disappointing as without your hacking computer access will be difficult. What you have picked up on with your physical inspection is that the security of the site is subtly above the other similar businesses in Downtown, nothing great but good.  A good number of the locks you could hack easily with the computer, but you will need to bring it. To be fair you had no intention of entering the place today, only to look around, if access was easy you would have probably chanced it. \n\nAs you are thinking on the best solution to get access, or to even bother you hear the noise of a window opening below you. You leave it for a few minutes and then look over the edge, the window is reachable and you reckon you can look through it without being observed. So after waiting for a few more minutes you climb down to get a better look. What you find is an empty office and on an impulse, you decide to chance it.  There is not likely to be any security inside and being a skilled infiltrator you have brought a rebreather with 20mins oxygen at high exertion, not uncommon on Evindium where outside the city limits oxygen is scarce. The rebreather will help to disguise you as well, should you be seen. The key thing in your mind is if hallucinogenic gas is being released in the place, you won’t end up a mindless simpleton. \n\n[[See how this goes|FW3.3A]]\n</div><div tiddler="Intel13.1" tags="" created="201510201952" modifier="twee" twine-position="4910,4630">&lt;img src=data/mag1.png&gt;\n\nWhen all is done you scout around the site with Jane and talk things over.

What Jane needs is a place where you can trust the occupants fully... Maybe one of your allies can help?\n\nYou decide to think upon it for the time being. You have bought some time but if the Magnum is found then Jane will still be caught as well. As you say goodbye to Jane, you watch the hangar doors start to close and the Magnum becomes hidden from sight.\n\n&lt;img src=data/mag2.png&gt;\n\nWith somewhat positive thoughts you head back with the smugglers to their hideout.

Not that thing, Celeste! It is too big.

But a bunch of thugs, nah.\n\nLenny picking up on where the conversation is going intercedes and tells Carla straight that he thinks she has lost the wager. Lenny is really pleased with this state of affairs and tells you that Carla has refused to offer her body in exchange for payments, and like all things not offered it is wanted more. Carla stares at Lenny defiantly but you can tell that she is just putting on a brave face.\n\nLenny grinning even more states &quot;So Carla, you said that if you lost this wager you would get down on your knees and beg to suck me off, so now do it&quot;. The last part is said with quiet menace. Carla knows that the game is up and sits down on her knees and quietly askes to suck Lenny's cock. You know the game and Carla is asked to say it louder, and then more loudly as Lenny unzips his fly and produces his member.\n\nYou watch highly aroused as Carla is roughly face fucked and publically humiliated in Rucks Pool Bar. The whole things ends with Lenny pulling out of a gagging Carla and emptying his load over Carla's face and tits. With Lenny laughing Carla stands up wipes as much spunk off her face as she can and tells Lenny that he got what he wanted which sets Lenny laughing even more and Carla still trying to keep up appearance beckons you to follow her.\n\nYou do so and as you walk off to the toilets Carla states, &quot;Celeste, I thought I knew you, I thought you would do it, now look at me I was wrong, a known domme face fucked like a bit of meat in the bar, this gets round my business will fall apart&quot; \n\n&quot;Evindium is a big city, if Shaun does not know then I doubt anyone in Ruck's does either, you could also wear a mask&quot; you gently retort\n\n&quot;Heh, but Celeste how did I get it so wrong&quot; says Carla with the calculating sound back in her voice.\n\nYou don't really know how to answer, have you found yourself in a submissive relationship, you guess you have.

Listening in, it becomes clear, they want out, out of Xena.\n\nAs you listen you start to formulate a plan of action, these people are basically prisoners in this facility. Due to the work Xena will not let them out, and the pair of them are 9 months in, to a 6 month on site contract. They both fear that they will die in this place, but fear more the future.  You decide that you can take them out if needed and drop out of the ventilation duct and pick up a nearby steel bar.  Neither have seen you and you make your entrance, blocking their escape route.\n\n“That is treasonous talk ladies, lucky I’m not with Xena………..”\n\nThere is a stunned silence, a look of abject fear from both women as they take in your suited outfit, then one speaks.\n\n“You’re not Xena security……..?” a half question, half repeat of what you just said.\n\n“Commonwealth Special Forces” you say, giving them a half lie, after all if you told them you volunteered to come here they would think you insane.\n\nThey believe you, not really having much choice in the matter and you spend the next 20 mins discussing plans.  Either way you are going to escort them out of the complex, but the problem is they are going to be missed. You will also need to deactivate the security systems, to get them out the way you came in. After all they don’t have a stealth suit. \n\nAs you think about, you only have one real choice, and that is to create a distraction that will keep the security forces //entertained// long enough for the scientists to escape. You tell them this, being careful not to say it is the only sensible option in your head. You ask what is being created in the science lab and see the women shudder…..\n\n“It is a monstrosity, a terror weapon to be unleashed on a population, like a dog but made from some alien DNA on a quarantined planet called Abraxas” says the first woman\n\nThe second continues; “We have created a number of things in there, the //dog// has been the biggest success, it can bread with human females and has a number of genetic kill switches and failsafe’s built into it, truly something evil” she says, looking genuinely remorseful. \n\nYou think it over, and come to a conclusion did they come down to this place to create a genetic monstrosity, with a money over morals approach, then get second thoughts? Or did they end up here not knowing what they were going to do, being experts in their field?  Do they deserve to be fed to their creation, an ethically just end?  Or do you care, being just curious in what this place is all about?\n\n[[What did you think you were making when you took the job?|FM3.1A]]\n[[What else have you made?|FM3.1B]]\n</div><div tiddler="FM3.3" tags="" created="201712172103" modifier="twee" twine-position="1690,6450">You decide that the best bet is to disable the security system, luckily for you they are quite easy to access and your hacking system in your stealth suit soon makes short work of the access credentials.\n\nYou set the system to open all doors in the access area, and to disable the incinerators.  To make sure that someone else does not reset the system, you lock it down to your access only and set a generic message to all other users.  Typically, the system throws an error message to you, and you know you have messed it up, whether your thought, or poor coding in the access system you don’t know. Before you can play with the system anymore you hear voices and get out of sight.\n\n“Door just let me in Jack, didn’t get me to swipe through, looks like the system has gone down?” says a male voice.\n\n“Strange, if it goes down the doors should lock fast, this sounds bad” says another male voice, with a panicking edge to it. \n\nThen the alarm klaxon’s sound and a tannoy message comes out; “Containment breach in Zone C, Sector 4, 7 and 9, all staff evacuate, security enroute”, the message repeats.\n\nA wave of fear washes over you, this security system did not just control the access corridor, it clearly covered a wider area, maybe the bulk of the facility?  Either way the security forces are going to be busy, but you don’t want to be around when they start investigating…….\n\n[[Get out of here|FM3.3A]]\n</div><div tiddler="FM3.2" tags="" created="201712102214" modifier="twee" twine-position="1550,6450">The best way to ensure you get out of the science labs is to turn off the incinerators and door lock system. From what you can tell all access out of the science labs has to be approved by people outside of the lab, so once you are in, you would need someone to vouch for you, to let you back out again. Something that is not going to happen you suspect, maybe you could kidnap someone and get them to front the request, but you suspect there will be an airlock system, designed to make sure noting nasty creeps out. \n\nSo the only sure fire way of getting in, would be to sabotage the security, well safety system. The whole idea does feel you with a little bit of unease, what is in there?  The incinerators could be there for a very good reason?  It really depends on what is in there, virus or genetic experiments? If the latter and they are working on some Xena super soldiers then releasing them could get you a chance to enter the core area? As the guards down in this area are distracted with the science lab situation.  Dangerous all round though……..

You know this means he has adjusted the restraints so he can bounce you forwards in time with his thrusts. It is at least a better fate than having your arms dislocated.\n\nOnce the gauntlets stop moving, he stands in front of you as you’re locked in a tiring position. To keep himself amused he slaps you round the face a few times with his erect cock, then rubs pre cum onto your cheek.\n\nWith that out of the way of he walks behind you and takes up position by your ass. He kneels and starts to rub his head along your wet pussy lip in a teasing fashion. He stops this only to reach round and play with your tits, squeezing them, crushing your nipples as he pulls them towards him. When he tires of that game, he places a steadying hand on your hip and guides his cock inside you. \n\nWith a slight moan from you, his cock slides into your wet hole. After a few steady strokes, he gets into the swing of things and starts to fuck you slowly. His hand reaches around to your neck and he alternates between pulling your chin upwards and choking you.\n\n&quot;Your mine now, bitch.

They may not truly like you, but perhaps they’ll respect you after tonight, even if not as a lady.  Before all the bikes are gone the Mistress walks out of the alley, hips swaying seductively, the collar and chain held in her hands. You’re sure she will do well tonight in the Red Light District.  As the last to leave, the leader chucks you some money for a taxi fare and speeds off. \n\nIt dawns on you that you are going to have to walk out of the alley to get a taxi naked and covered in fluids. You desperately scan the alley and don’t find anything to clean yourself up with so you use your hands but it doesn’t do much for you. Knowing there is a taxi rink around the corner, you scamper out of the alley towards a free taxi and make a run for it.

What would they think if they knew the truth?

The guards watch, throwing encouragement your way, as you slowly strip off your jumpsuit and your underwear. When you are naked you lie back on the mattress and spread your legs revealing your glistening slit. The guards waste no time and within seconds the first man is on top of you bucking away and slamming into your pussy, pinning your non-resistant arms down by your side.\n \nYou look to the side and limply lie back, enjoying the pounding you are getting. It does not take long before the first guard grunts and he cums inside you. The next man gets on top of you and repeats, firstly groaning about having to get sloppy seconds. This one takes a little longer to cum, but does so with a degrading shout of &quot;Take that, you fucking slut!&quot; As you lie there, legs spread, panting, you wonder when you will hit your first orgasm will come. Nothing matters to you but reaching that sensation and you notice you’ve become an addict, just waiting for their next fix of dirty, deviant sex.\n \nThe next guard is the one that spoke to you earlier about handcuffs and indicates he wants you on your knees with your arms cuffed behind your back. Following the instructions, you get off the mattress and kneel before him while a guard who has fucked you applies the handcuffs to your limp arms, now positioned behind your back. When the cuffs are secure, he pulls out his cock and points the tip towards your mouth. You open up and begin to suck as he puts his hands around your head.\n \nYou are roughly face fucked, his balls slamming into your chin, as you gag for air. Drool and pre-cum drip out from your mouth and onto your knees and belly. When you are turning blue from the lack of oxygen, he roughly pulls your head back by your hair and his cock pops out of your mouth. While you pant for air, he slaps you across the face with his cock and speaks up.\n \n&quot;Now, bitch, like the obedient fuck slut you are, I want you to get on the mattress and present yourself to me, now. I’m going to fuck your tight, little ass,&quot; he says eying you up like a piece of meat. As you start to stand up he shouts again, &quot;No! Stay on your knees and face the corner.&quot;\n \nYou move forwards on your knees, struggling to keep your balance as you have no hands. You are aware that the collar and chain is being picked up nearby but no longer care; there is a fog in your mind stopping any further resistance. As you reach your destination, you are pushed forwards so your face smashes into the mattress. You lie there prone on the mattress, hands cuffed behind your back, as two guards pin you down and a third applies and locks the collar around your neck.\n \nThe guard who said he was going to fuck you up the ass grabs your hips and pulls them up. With no arms to steady you, you try and take as much weight as possible on your legs and use your back muscles to stop your neck from taking the pressure. You then feel his cock at the entrance of your anus and his hands spreading your butt cheeks apart. The invading tip penetrates you slowly, then slides in balls deep and you let out a moan. As he starts to slowly fuck you, his hands make their way to your tits where he roughly fondles them and pinches your nipples.\n \n&quot;You are our fuck slave now, understand? No-one will be able to find you. You can’t escape. If you want any food from now on, you will have to beg for it,&quot; he says with an evil laugh. &quot;Is this everything you wanted?&quot;\n\nYou say no words but involuntary you push back against his cock, helping him slam harder into your sore hole as you start to black out.\n \n[[Face your future as a fuckslut|Random Rl9C.1]]</div><div tiddler="RTG2.3B" tags="" created="201608161154" modifier="twee" twine-position="2110,5330">When the other contestant notices you, you don’t make any threatening gestures and approach them.

It is time those damn hunters get some payback,&quot; he eagerly declares.\n\nYou don’t want to risk getting involved with this further so you point him off in a random direction and hope he finds his way to the exit.\n\nThe rest of your trek through the tunnels is uneventful. At one point, you come spot another contestant in the distance, let off a few rounds, but ultimately because they reacted quickly. You wonder how the show’s management will try to get the guns off of you. When you reach the exit for the tunnels, a contestant visibly flinches when she sees the gun. You’re both not allowed to speak but it is clear she wants to know if you killed Shadow Viper. No-one from the show’s management comes out to retrieve the weapon and you both take a seat in a booth to watching the video feeds of the tunnels.\n\nOne video shows footage of the contestant who went looking for Shadow Viper get ambushed by her. She sneaks up on him from behind and pierces his head in with a sharp rock and then snaps his neck. You are surprised she got free and the man was a fool for spending so much time looking for her. If you had given him the right directions, maybe things would have been different.\n\nShadow Viper survives and all of the remaining contestants make it in. They all take in the pistols next to you and work out what has happened. When you are all called in for the next round a couple of armed show security staff take the weapons off you, saying nothing else. The $Contestants remaining contestants are split up and individually taken by vehicle to the starting points of the next challenge; the sniper alley.

You understand why Carla did this and most of the men will be focused your chest rather than the game when they play you now. \n\nWith a plan now in your head you flirt outrageously: you flash your panties, show lots of leg, and give the men good views down your dress. You win all of your games until you come up to the man you liked and flirted with at the bar; he is a cool customer and the best player of the lot. He is also bit of a bad boy as at the start of the game he rests his hand on your ass and gives you a light squeeze through your dress as you line up the breaking shot. \n\nYou turn your head and give him your best smile and ask, &quot;Where do you think you are putting your hand?&quot;\n\n&quot;On your gorgeous butt, of course,&quot; he says and he gives your buttock another squeeze. \n\nYou decide to ignore him and focus on the shot. When you line up the shot, he removes his hand both out of courtesy and to avoid getting a pool cue in his belly. After a bit more flirting and a few more shots, things are looking a little bad for you. You catch Carla looking at you and holding her breasts, emphasizing her cleavage. Your competition notices the movement and then you see the realization of what is happening flash across his face.\n\n&quot;You are trying to distract me,&quot; he says as he looks down at his groin where there is a visible bulge, &quot;it’s working. I’m still not going to lose though.&quot; With that he stands in front of you and grabs your hips and pulls you in close to him so you come to rest just short of his chest. &quot;Why don't we have a little chat over in the corner,&quot; he asks and points to a secluded corner. You nod and head over.\n\nWhen you get there, he grabs you under behind your shoulders and pulls you close for a kiss. When you don't resist he pulls you closer and you two share a passionate, drunken kiss. Soon his hands are exploring your bare back, your ass, and then you lift your right leg until it is resting on his hip. With one hand he grabs your leg and with the other hand reaches down between your legs and presses on the growing damp spot on your panties. Once he feels them, he moves in closer and you feel a bulge press against you. When you break off from kissing he immediately asks if you would like to go somewhere quiet as he knows a place nearby. You know what this means and if you accept then your panties will be slipping past your ankles.\n\n[[Go outside and indulge your lust|RPool2D1A]]\n[[It is time for you two to make a deal|RPool2D2]]</div><div tiddler="Int22.0" tags="" created="201609071927" modifier="twee" twine-position="4210,6170">&lt;img src=data/cob3.png&gt;\n\nThe Cobra Gang leader tells you about the induction process, for men it is a continuous one on one set of fights until the initiate gives up or the gang members gives the thumbs up. Fighting ability, grit and determination are assessed as the numbers and continuous fighting wear even the best fighter down.  For the women it is slightly different, a female initiate will fight a pack of Cobra gang girls who will attack as a pack. These fights are stretched out with the initiate being allowed to regain her feet several times until her fighting ability is gone. Then round two will start with a sexual assault culminating in a scarring as Clawz gets her claws into an initiate.\n\n&lt;img src=data/cob4.png&gt;\n\nMen that give up, or are considered too weak are killed, the girls are spared after being gang banged by the gang and offered gang slut status. \n\nYou are offered the choice of fighting against the men, or the women.

I am the one who poisoned him!&quot; she says in an uncharacteristically emotional voice. You look at her stunned by this turn of events, struggling to take it all in.  As you consider trying to comfort her, the icy calm returns to Lina’s face and she ushers you out of the garden until you enter a bedroom. \n\nLina smiles and disrobes in front of you. &quot;I did promise you a special time, did I not? I’d also like to forget about what happened in the garden.&quot; With that she presses into you and kisses you passionately. Your body responds to her and you embrace her as she slides her hand inside the front of your leggings. You’re still tense from what just happened, but after a few minutes with Lina’s skilled fingers teasing your clit, the fight is temporarily forgotten.\n\nAs you are undressed by Lina, she starts to plant kisses all over your body along the way. As Lina kneels to finish pulling your leggings off, she leans in and kisses your pussy as the leggings slip off. She looks up at you with longing eyes and you tell her to lay down as you have something else in mind for her too. Lina does as you request and you proceed to sit on her face and then begin to eat her out. You both lost track of time as you get lost in the eroticism of sixty-nining with one another. After a handful of orgasms a piece you two clean up, get dressed, and you are invited to a formal dinner.\n \nThe dinner is a polite family affair with a few friends of Hu Chung’s. Nothing is mentioned of the earlier events and it is as if nothing has happened. The dinner ends with drinks in the garden which has been cleaned and rapidly repaired. The cut to the wall from Lina’s swing is still visible if you know what you are looking for, reminding you that that could have been your head. Unsurprisingly, you decline all alcoholic beverages and were a little put off your food. As you head out you are told that Lina will be in touch.\n \nYou don’t know how to feel about that at this point. Lina's words haunt you slightly, become her sword mistress.

Shaun's mates all lap this information and you notice most of them checking out your legs and cleavage. Within seconds an argument nearly breaks out over who will buy you a drink. After making a suggestion for what to get, you soon find a drink in your hand. As the conversation starts, Shaun tells you that Carla will be joining you all later in the evening and that she is just having a busy day at the office. You nearly choke on your drink as it is clear that Shaun still has absolutely no idea of what Carla actually does for a living.\n\nWell, if you //are// going to be the centre of attention, you figure it is time to lap it up. You’re already used to being 'one of the lads' in the male dominated military and you quickly join in with their stereotypical male banter.

While Shaun is a good decade younger, there is one man who is totally your type amongst the group and you drop a few subtle hints along with an obvious remark that he has a good figure.\n\nTime in the bar draws to a close as the boys decide to head over to one of the pool halls. When asked you tell them you don't know the rules and they could teach you if they want. Shaun believes your lie and looks excited by the idea of teaching you.

Hu Chung has a massive grudge about this as he sees that conflict will bring the attentions of the corporations onto the gangs and a crackdown will be implemented on the perceived trouble makers. The corporations will likely pick a side as they are not interested in the ethics but the impact to their bottom-line. Hu Chung’s only son was killed while in the Dragon Gang and Hu blames the leader for giving him risky positions. \n\nHu Chung though has begun taking his own risk, fiddling with the profits on the gambling business. From the time when he was influential in the Dragon Gang he dipped into their hidden reserves. This money has been spent on modifying Lina to become an elite assassin. Hu sees this as the way to wage conflicts without risking his personal safety. \n\nHe tells you with great pleasure that Lina was getting a little too rebellious and he has implanted a submissive/master command in her modifications as well. He believes that a women should know their place and your male master must keep you in your place. Apart from irritating, you this makes you think about your relationship with Sid briefly before brushing aside the notion that he would ever try and control you.\n \nHu has been undertaking lots of weapons and martial arts training for Lina, along with spending time with Giannio to get training in etiquette, politics and to be involved with local affairs. Hu is telling you this as he wants you to join Lina on her first mission and to also provide some advanced training if you can. Hu will help as much as he can to get you close to your corporate target. \n\nHu says he will let you think about it and that he only has told you this as he is dying. Before he passes and he wants to see this happen as he has a specific choice in mind for the leadership of the Dragon Gang. You nod your head at his but glance around Hu when a hacking laugh erupts from him. You then notice Lina holding a katana and two men with firearms enter the garden.\n \n&quot;I want to make sure you have the skills necessary for this.

He needs to keep his thoughts focused on me of course.&quot; \n\nYou nod but don't say much back, a bit confused about the whole submission thing.\n\nCarla soon works out that you beat Shaun but assesses your skill as lacking if you hope to beat the rest of the competition. Carla really believes you can't possibly beat all of them and says if you win against all of them then she will treat you to another night of pool and you can ask her to do anything. When she sees a devilish grin start to grow on your face she adds, &quot;Anything for //you// only.&quot; \n\nThe number of drinks you have had makes the decision making process fairly easy but you ask how you can possibly win if the other players are better than you what the forfeit is if you can’t beat them. To your surprise, Carla tells you that there is no forfeit but in order to win you will need to flirt and show off your assets to the men. She suggests you stretch or bend over when they are taking their shots. \n\n&quot;Just think,&quot; Carla whispers, &quot;Win and you can have me licking you out like an obedient lapdog.&quot; With no forfeit, a little bit of dampness in your panties, and a lot of alcohol in your system, you agree to her terms. Carla sounds extremely pleased then says, &quot;As a matter of fact, let me help you out a bit.&quot; \n\nShe turns back to the group of Shaun and his mates and calls out, &quot;Hey boys, have you met my good friend, Celeste? She is a right party girl!&quot; As they look over at the two of you, Carla proceeds to pull the strap on your dress down, exposing your right breast to the boys.\n\n&lt;img src=data/rpool2.png&gt;\n\n[[Shaun catches your eye|RPool2D]]</div><div tiddler="RPool2B" tags="" created="201508222158" modifier="twee" twine-position="1690,1130">The first game of pool goes well but after that Shaun stops buying that you got a few 'lucky' shots and works out that actually you are pretty good and can hold your own with any social pool player.

Shaun looks a little embarrassed but tells you that he is wearing a device that will administer a harsh shock any time he gets too aroused or gets an erection. This is considered to be punishment for anytime Shaun looks at other girls.

You were at the level where you could just about scrape into the lower end of the planetary elite but had no hope in the Commonwealth Championships that covered every inhabited planet. New Terra having a population in the billions and Evindium Prime hovering around 15 million, chances were that you would rank up at the top end, if not be the best competitive sword fighter on Evindium.\n\nEither way, as you enter the Dojo you are greeted by a female receptionist who offers to show you around and to discuss membership. You take the tour and are shown around the five match courts, one of which is a larger arena for team based and battle royale matches. The remaining four are for more traditional one-on-one fights. The Dojo also has three training halls dedicated to the different fighting disciplines; a normal gym; and a load of leisure facilities including a spa, swimming pools, and a small bar.\n\nA three month membership including equipment rental fees would cost twenty-five credits based on your New Terra sword fighter license. \n\nAfter the tour is over the receptionist asks you if you would be interested in joining the Dojo.\n\n[[You decide to join the Evindium Sword Dojo|Dojo1A]]\n[[You say you will think about it and leave|Apartment]]</div><div tiddler="Objectives" tags="slam" created="201508232121" modifier="twee" twine-position="2250,150">&lt;h2&gt;Objective Details&lt;/h2&gt;This page holds the details for the main game objectives:\n&lt;h3&gt;Primary Objective - Have Planetary Security Records Wiped&lt;/h3&gt;The Security Forces have Jane's faical scan on record. If Jane goes through any local security checkpoints she will immediately be apprehended. Erasing these records will remove that risk and allow her to move more freely.\n&lt;h3&gt;Primary Objective - Getting Jane away from the hangar complex&lt;/h3&gt;Jane is in an exposed position onboard the Magnum, unable to leave. If the Magnum is found then Jane will be captured. It is highly likely that Xena Operatives will be searching for the Magnum and the hangar complexes for visiting offworlders will be an obvious leap after they finsih checking departure records. (Note: Xena will not know that Magnum is damaged at the start of the game.)\n&lt;h3&gt;Secondary Objective - Xena Security Records Wipe&lt;/h3&gt;Xena will have their own record of Jane. With luck, it is only stored on this planet's database. This record could mean that Jane will be captured at a later date if you don't erase it.\n&lt;h3&gt;Primary Objective - Magnum Repair&lt;/h3&gt;The Magnum is barely spaceworthy and if it did somehow manage space flight it would not be allowed through the jumpgate due to debris risks. Offplanet ships are only allowed hangar space in the Space Quarter. Someone would need to be bribed in order to use a private landing space or warehouse. \n&lt;h3&gt;Primary Objective - Hiding the Magnum&lt;/h3&gt;If the Magnum is found in its damaged state it will likely be impounded or an ambush will be set up. It is imperative that the Magnum is hidden before it is found in this state. A landing zone outside the Space Quarter will need to be secured.\n&lt;h3&gt;Primary Objective - One dependable ally&lt;/h3&gt;An ally is required to aid Celeste on missions; primarily used for backup and support.\n&lt;h3&gt;Secondary Objective - One supporter/relationship&lt;/h3&gt;Supporters can help you out in various ways, often for free.\n&lt;h3&gt;Secondary Objective - Support weapons&lt;/h3&gt;Extra weapons for your kit open up additional choices and missions. Certain death missions can be overcome by specialized equipment.  \n\n&lt;&lt;back&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Intel 10 Start" tags="" created="201505122225" modifier="twee" twine-position="4070,4350">Before you go to this meeting you decide you had better get all the Intel available on the main gangs on Evindium. You have had Jane scour the web and contact anyone who might be able to provide you with any sort of help.\n\nYou form a good idea about the [[gangs|Gangs]] on Evindium and certainly know that it is close to all out street war. You reckon you are going to deal with the boss of the Aruba Syndicate as they are known to control the smuggling and are being heavily pressed by both the established Delta Cartel and the up and coming Dragon Gang. What really gives it away is that the meeting location is a nightclub associated with the Aruba Syndicate on the outskirts of the Red Light District.\n\nAs you arrive you are told that the door staff are expecting you and when you give your name you are ushered up to an empty VIP lounge which features a fish tank and a one way window looking down onto the dance floor. They have invited you at a time when the club is really busy and you know that the empty VIP area is meant to make you feel very special. Admittedly, it has worked a bit.\n\nAs you are admiring the view, you hear footsteps and an exquisite looking lady walks in wearing next to nothing and offers you a drink. You decide to stick to water even though you fancy something a little stiffer to make sure you’re completely alert. The girl gives you a surprised look and then heads off to the small VIP bar to get your selection. Seconds later she is back and you sip at your chilled beverage.\n\nAfter roughly five minutes has passed a number of men walk in and you are introduced to [[Michael Benz|Crimelord]], the head of the Aruba Syndicate.\n\n[[Try to feel him out|Intel10.1]]</div><div tiddler="CF5B" tags="MORE IMAGE" created="201610022017" modifier="twee" twine-position="3090,4490">You let Kat get back to her feet still dazed from the kick to the head, you then send her sprawling with a mid-kick to the chest. Kat collides with the fence and you aim a roundhouse at her head to deliver the knockout blow.  To your surprise Kat manages to avoid the kick and gets in a brutal punch to your face, off balance from the kick you fall to the floor and Kat springs on you.\n\nYou hit the floor awkwardly and find Kat on top of you before you can get your guard up, it just takes Kat a moment to get your arm and apply a side arm bar, you are just too slow to stop it and Kat gets the position causing you to tap out.  The bitch lets out a jubilant victory scream and still holding your arm in the bar pushes her groin into your arm, using it to rub her pussy under the shorts. \n\n“You’re going to pay for that kick bitch” she mutters to you, you are not surprised, the donkey ride at the beginning was indicative of what would happen if you lost. The worst thing about it is that your arrogance got the better of you, here you are, now a loser.\n\nAs the victory is announced on the tannoy, Kat releases your arm, pulls down her fight shorts and sits astride your face.\n\n&quot;Make me cream….. loser&quot; Kat demands and you have little choice with the rules and the clean shaven sex shoved in your face. You get to the job at hand and tongue the pussy grinding away at your face, it does not take long and Kat orgasms on your face, shifting her bodyweight as much as possible on your face, just when you feel you are going to be suffocated by pussy she gets up. Kat tells you to kneel in front on her and strip to your underwear.  Again you do as commanded and start with pulling your T-shirt off, while you do so Kat pulls up your sports bra, bouncing your breasts at the same time.\n\n&quot;Nice pair there slut, look fake to me, you getting implant to make you more fuckable eh?&quot; she taunts you.\n\nYou do not respond and her let her pull the bra off and fling it into a corner. You watch as the bra lodges itself in the cage fence, like a lewd sign.  You next pull yourself out of your shorts, lifting one leg up from the kneeling position, followed by the other to get them off. You then get back into the kneeling position and wait for Kat’s instruction, feeling ominously protected by your sports panties covering your quim. \n\n&quot;Doggy position go&quot; shouts Kat and you oblige by getting on all fours, facing towards her. Kat smiles and walks behind you and you wait for her to climb on top. Instead she pulls down your panties to the knees and you get the feeling that she will enjoy the slightly restricted movement. Instead you get a painful smack on the arse, followed by one of Kat’s mitts being thrown at your head. This is followed by a pressure at your lips as Kat probes your sex with her fingers. Kat’s two fingers slip in easily to your wet pussy and she laughs and say she knew you were a slut.\n\nYou say nothing and two fingers turn into four and Kat’s other hand holds tightly onto your hair pulling your head backwards as she gives you a rough fingering.  Kat’s fingering turns into something more as not content with being knuckle deep she pushes more and manages to get her hold hand into your vagina up to the wrist. As the whole thing enters your stretched hold you let out a loud grunt as the air explodes out of you. \n\nKat’s hand pistons in and out of you and she gleefully tells you that her hand is now in a fist shape. You don’t take this in at first but the feeling down below of being stretched confirms the statement. The growing orgasm in you takes over and you pant in time with the thrusts until you climax and your vaginal muscles lock Kat’s fist inside of you, when the spasms subside Kat gives a yank on your head and pulls out her slick hand. With you still panting and your head held she wipes your pussy juices on your face and tits. \n\nAs you are coming round Kat gets up and with you still on your hands and knees mounts you and tells you to carry to the other side of the arena. A smack on the backside brings you to your senses and you carry Kat to the other side where she vaults off you and triumphantly walks out of the cage, arm raised up high. Knowing the punishment is over you collect your clothes and walk out the arena, spanked naked ass cheeks on show. \n\nYou struggle to take in what has just happened, you have never been fisted in your life, and for it to happen in public, and you orgasmed, strongly orgasmed.  You try to let the thoughts pass, imagine if you were in the military still and your fellow soldiers saw this. You would never live it down, as you get to the changing rooms the shame and humiliation hit you. Sitting on the cold bench, smelling pussy on your face you wonder whether this is all worth it. Never one to allow doubt to take hold you let the thoughts be replaced by winning the next fight. That is the most important thing now, it has to be. \n\n[[Get ready for your final fight|CF7]]\n\n&lt;&lt;set $CF5B to 1&gt;&gt;\n</div><div tiddler="CBA1" tags="" created="201601311940" modifier="twee" twine-position="1410,2110">It isn’t a very comfortable seat to be in and the design makes it impossible to keep your legs from spreading apart. The tension on your thighs as you try to get adjusted behind her confirms that this is likely going to be a very long trip around the block for your legs.\n \nShe kicks the bike into action and you are caught off guard. The vibrations of the seat against your thighs makes it even more difficult to get your legs in place. You have yet to settle in when she whips the bike into the street, jerking you off-balance, and back on your haunches and into place. You move slowly down the street, the vibration between your legs begins to spread further up your legs and you feel your reservations about the situation relax along with them.  \n\nWith no handrails, you lean into her back and wrap your arms around her waist.  You inhale a distinct combination of leather, her perfume, and something else you can't quite seem to place. You notice that your nipples are pressing against the fabric of your top, but this isn’t the only reaction you seem to be having to your joy ride. The vibrations have had the effect of very slowly parting your thighs apart and shaking you towards the nub of your seat.\n \nTime seems to slow to a crawl as you relish the first sensations as the nub comes in direct contact with your crotch. Your entire being is fixated upon the minute movements as your lips slowly begin to part against it. Sweat begins dripping from your body, and you’re not sure, but you believe that it is you that is groaning.  The goth girl turns back to check on you and you can see your own face mirrored in her glasses. Your face is painted with a look of dire, almost animalistic need as the look in her eyes is lost to you.\n \nYou realize that you are nearing the bar that you originally started at. You bounce with the bike as she rides over a bump and you feel the nub press hard into your clit and you find it impossible to move. You clutch onto her, gritting your teeth, as the unrelenting hum of the bike launches you into an explosive orgasm. You jerk into her back, your voice cracking, as your juices flood through your panties and down the legs of your jumpsuit.\n \nThe goth girl pulls the bike over, the vibrations lessening, and tells you that you have two seconds to get off the bike or you are going for a much longer ride. Your pussy tells you to stay on and see where things go, but your mind says you’ve proven your point.\n\n[[Pull yourself in tighter|CBA1A]] \n[[Wobble off of the bike|CBA1B]]</div><div tiddler="Int6.1" tags="" created="201512132136" modifier="twee" twine-position="4910,3370">You take a taxi to the same office block you visited before and again attend in a tight fitting dress with no panties. You justify this on the basis that a man who thinks he may have a chance for sex will overlook a few breaches in protocol a lot more easily.\n\nPhil, the clerk you had previously dealt with in regard to the weapons permit, has told you that his line manager can authorize the external planetary funds to be transferred. Phil tells you he will help clear up the paperwork and that his boss has already been told all about you. This no doubt is his way of saying that he’s told him about how you went commando and flashed your pussy. This is likely a rare occasion as most of these transactions are carried out by local lawyers rather than the applicants themselves. You suspect that few lawyers turn up going commando!\n\nWhen you sign in at reception you are directed to a lift which takes you ten floors up instead of being sent to the appointment booths like the previous time. As the doors open, you are greeted by an enthusiastic Phil who puts out a sweaty hand for you. As you shake hands, he holds you with a limp grasp and practically drools, checking out your body at the same time. The dress leaves little to the imagination.\n\nPhil asks you to follow him and you walk through a mainly male office and are greeted with a number of catcalls and jeers. You come to a manager’s officer surrounded with glass walls which has a stern looking man seated inside. Phil knocks on the door and is gestured to enter. After opening and holding the door open for you he follows you inside. \n\nYou are introduced to the manager, Hector, and you are asked to outline your request. You explain that you are looking to pull additional funds from your New Terra bank account to help build your new business. When you finish your case you wait for any questions they may have. Instead, Hector swivels his desk monitor around and you see a recording from the appointment booth you visited previously with Phil. The scene is paused and shows you in the moment of uncrossing your legs, your exposed slit clearly visible. You glance uncomfortably at Hector who is smiling.\n\n&quot;Interesting tactic there, Ms. Blake. The whole office were all envious of Phil here,&quot; gloats Hector.\n\n&quot;I see,&quot; you reply, holding Hector’s gaze and refusing to be drawn in.\n\n&quot;You were clearly planning on utilizing the same tactic here today, Ms. Blake. As much as I would enjoy it, I have a proposition for you.&quot; He says with a short pause to let suspense set in. &quot;I want you to crawl around the office floor on all fours as you are. After you’ve crawled the entire distance, you will then come back into this office, pull your dress off, and wait for me to sign off on the transfer. Will you do this, Ms. Blake?&quot;\n\nYou stare uncomfortably into his eyes as he waits for your response.\n\n[[There is no chance you’ll crawl around like some animal|Intel6.3]]\n[[You just want to get this over this and agree|Intel6.2]]</div><div tiddler="Carla5E" tags="" created="201805262332" modifier="twee" twine-position="3930,570">When you think about what type of session you want today, you start to reflect on your feelings with Carla. What had started out as just playful fun has led to you exploring a much more submissive side of you than you thought you possessed. \n\nThe conflict on your face must be apparent as Carla asks, &quot;Hey, Celeste. Usually you make up your mind quicker than this. Is something bothering you,&quot; she asks while staring deep into your eyes.\n\n&quot;W-well,&quot; you feel your face flush as you try to speak; it isn’t like you to be so timid. \n\nCarla just smiles and interjects, &quot;Or maybe you’re interested in a more permanent relationship and don’t know how to ask?&quot; You feel your face burn as your eyes drop to the floor and Carla grins wickedly at the sight. &quot;You //do// remember I offer them only to my best-trained pets, right, Celeste?&quot;\n\nYou nod meekly.\n\n&quot;Then kneel and look into my eyes, pet,&quot; Carla commands. You hesitate slightly, then kneel on the ground in front of Carla and look up into her eyes. Carla looks you over before she begins to address you again.\n\n&quot;From this day forward, whenever we are in private, you will address me as Mistress or Mistress Carla only. When you show up for a session, I expect you to kneel before me completely nude and wait for me to address you before speaking. I also expect your obedience and respect in all situations. Am I clear, //my little pet//?&quot;\n\nYou nearly cum from hearing you address her as her pet. You never expected to end up at this point, but all you can do is return her gaze and mutter, &quot;Yes, Mistress.&quot;\n\nCarla reaches down and runs her fingers through your hair as her rich voice penetrates your core. &quot;Good. All of my services are now open to you, my pet. \n\n&quot;Please understand that many pets have ended up broke or broken if they over indulge in the more extreme avenues of my kink. It’s not that I mind mindless pets, but it’s a lot more fun for me when I know there is still a fire inside of them and yet they still choose to submit. So, what will type of session would you like today, my pet?&quot;\n\nYou smile speak &quot;Mistress, could we please share another bondage session together?&quot; you ask her and blush.\n\n&quot;Of course we can, my pet. As a matter of fact, now that your body has built up some endurance to pain and basic kink, I think it's time for you to experience what it's like to be completely powerless. Does the idea of suspension training excite you?&quot; she candidly queries. \n\n&quot;Yes, Mistress!&quot; you gleefully respond to her.\n\n&quot;Then we'll be using the splash room again. I hope you didn't make any plans for the evening because special sessions like these tend to run well into the night,&quot; your Mistress informs you as she makes her way over to you. &quot;Up, now. The time it will take to create your harness will be at least an hour on its own if I can't rope my receptionist into helping me,&quot; she finishes with a chuckle.\n\nYou are left to wait in the splash room while she goes to get assistance. Unsurprisingly, both return with restraints in their hands.\n\n&quot;I hear you'll be hanging around with us for a while,&quot; the receptionist quips while taking in your body like she always seems too.\n\n&quot;Let us know if you feel uncomfortable at any point, my pet,&quot; your Mistress warns.\n\n&quot;Yes, Mistress,&quot; you agree.\n\nThe two take their time snaking the ropes around your breasts and midsection. Your arms are firmly secured and you are made to drop to your knees while they keep working. When securing the ropes that run across your pussy, the receptionist intentionally rubs the rope along your wetting sex just to make you squirm. Once a basic harness is finished up, you lie on your stomach and they tie your legs back and apart so you're stuck in a constant kneeling state.\n\nYour Mistress and her receptionist then secure a final rope though the ones running down your back. She then walks over to you with a gimp hood with a zipper over its mouth, slides it over your head, then unzips the mouth. If it weren't for your implants, you doubt you'd be able to hear anything through the material. You feel a sudden lurch against your back and feel yourself lift off of the ground. A few solid jerks later, and if you had to guess, you're now at least four feet off of the ground.\n\n&quot;I'll be back to check on you shortly,&quot; comes your Mistress's voice from somewhere beyond the hood, startling you. &quot;Hehe. I'll be back periodically to tease you, pet. Scream if you need anything in between and someone will come,&quot; she softly reminds you then you hear the door shut.\n\n[[Learn the ancient ways of the ornament|BondageTraining3A]]\n&lt;&lt;set $CPTimer to $Days + 3&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $SubTrg +=1&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Shebo5A" tags="" created="201711161959" modifier="twee" twine-position="5050,1690">&lt;img src=data/bd1.png&gt;\n\nThe situation does not surprise you, a masterwork mechanical bondage table, all oiled cogs and shiny metal giving it an appearance of age and sophistication.

Now you have been playing kiss chase and it is payback time, right? If so, I figure you need to get stripping. Now.&quot;\n\nYou know that arguing will not help, that you brought a lot of this onto yourself, and that some part of you wants this. That part has already moistened your pussy and you can feel your nipples rubbing against your clothes. Still thinking about all this, you start to strip off your jumpsuit until only your underwear remains. The guards are all standing around smiling and grinning to themselves. \n\n&quot;Put your hands on your head&quot; states the supervisor and you comply. The supervisor motions for the guards to go over to you and they grab your wrists and lead you to the pedestrian walking rail on the side of the tunnel. Once you get there, two officers proceed to handcuff you the rail. &quot;Bend over and hold the rail, Miss,&quot; laughs the now approaching supervisor, &quot;You two move away. I'm going first.&quot; The supervisor turns his attention back to you and says, &quot;Now look up at the cameras and say you want it, that you have wanted it for a long time, and today you are going to get it.&quot; At the same time the supervisor, now directly behind you, grabs your hips and pulls you back towards him until your butt hits his crotch and you are fully bent over. \n\nYou say nothing and the supervisor’s right hand reaches past your hips and onto your pubic mound. His hand runs a little and then he slips a finger under your panties until he finds your wet hole. &quot;I knew it&quot; he laughs, &quot;The bitch is dripping down there!&quot; he exclaims with a chuckle. Shame floods you and you look down at the floor; he is right, you are totally wet enough to have soaked through your panties with your juices. You say nothing when the man starts lowering your panties and you willingly spread your legs. You’re wet enough that as they slide down they briefly cling to your pussy from the wetness. The supervisor now reinserts his finger which is soon joined by two more as he starts to play with you. His fingers alternate between thrusting and circular movements. After a being teased like this for a bit a lewd moan involuntarily escapes your mouth.\n\nThe supervisor leans over your backs and pulls you in close to his face by your hair and whispers in your ear, &quot;Now do what you were told and tell the cameras how badly you want it.&quot;\n\n&quot;I want it,&quot; comes the meek sound of your voice.\n\n&quot;Say it louder,&quot; commands the supervisor, ripping his slick fingers out of your pussy and wiping them on your cheek.\n\n&quot;I want... I want it bad and I’ve wanted it for a long time and today you are going to fuck me&quot; you say speaking more loudly with the last bit coming out as a snarl.\n\n&quot;Good girl,&quot; he says boastfully. &quot;Here’s a little reward for ya.&quot; He then stuffs three fingers roughly into your pussy causing you to nearly buckle from the mix of pleasure and pain.\n\n[[Moan in pleasure|Random RL6A1]]</div><div tiddler="Random RL6B" tags="" created="201507242033" modifier="twee" twine-position="6030,5050">It is quite clear in your mind that to surrender here is to invite yourself to be raped.

You put your hands up and when a security officer gets close to you with his stun baton drawn you take your chance and strike. \n\nIn a split second the officer is down and you grab the stun baton. Two others quickly close in on you and it seems as if they attack in slow motion. You avoid both their clumsy attacks and stun both guards which cause them to collapse to the floor. This leaves two guards armed with stun batons and the one you struck who is now slowly getting up. You quickly go on the offensive and the last two guards quickly fall. You notice the fifth man now reaching for his sidearm and throw the stun baton at his head, which connects and sends him flying. With only a light contact it will not knock him out, so you quickly chase the man down and kick the firearm out of his hand. With the other four incapacitated, you focus on this man and quickly handcuff him to the tunnel’s pedestrian rail. You then go for the sidearm and stun baton.  \n\nThe man starts to wake up and spots you coming back over with his sidearm and stun baton. &quot;Miss, I wasn't going to shoot you, we were just going to have some fun&quot; he splutters out, panic written across his face. \n\n&quot;So am I,&quot; you state, &quot;How do I get out?&quot; \n\n&quot;I don't know,&quot; the man squeals. \n\n&quot;See I knew I was going to have some fun,&quot; you reply with a wicked grin and reach down into his pants and pull out his flaccid penis. \n\n&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; he asks.\n\n&quot;You will see,&quot; you reply.\n\nYou start to get his penis hard and once fully erect you begin slowly masturbating it. You ask the man again how you get out and get the same answer. You then bring the stun baton out and place it on his penis. The man starts to pull away but you grab his balls lightly. The man understands your intent and stops. With fear in his eyes he gives up how to open the door. You tell him you are a corporate assassin and if he messes with you again he can guess what will happen.

That brings a smile to a number of faces and you are immediately reminded that you said you might strip again under the right circumstances. Someone chimes in that they got the pole for you, followed by a neutral look from yourself as you think it over.

It is all very clever in a disturbing way, the training is designed to get the woman ready for a partial mind wipe. What is left is a woman capable of basic tasks that gains immense sexual pleasure from being used and is skilled in sex. If they get it wrong an unstable psycho is created with various traits but either way rich owners get quite frustrated when the girl bites their cock off. \n\nThe first stage is to get the girl submissive and willing to accept sex for an easier life and creature comforts, girls who don’t submit are tortured until the sex seems the better option.  Once the girls are submissive and happy to carry out more deviant acts the mind wiping starts, stripping off layers of the mind and being trained in BDSM, massage and Karma Sutra inspired sex. After all the new master may want gentle loving sex, or rough doggy style from his property. Sarah managed to play them off, acting submissive until the mind wiping was going to start, then going super aggressive, putting the plan backwards. \n\nSarah had no mind wiping but she participated voluntarily in some pretty sordid sex, and resisted a lot of punishment. The report says they were close to giving up on her, which would have led to an execution.  The irony is that she has some similar traits to you, you wonder fleetingly whether she enjoyed any of the sordid sex before getting that thought out of your mind. Stress makes people do strange things you remind yourself.\n\nWhen you meet Sarah, she looks a little dangerous, an angry gleam in her eyes keeps the men away and you buy her a drink and head to a quiet corner. It appears that she has worked some things out already, that you are someone dangerous with a ship. So you must work for someone off planet with local enemies, hence the cloak and dagger operation to get the ship repaired.  Sarah points out that you must have escaped the guards quickly and violently and you outline what happened and how you got free. As Sarah seems to have worked it all out she summarises that this wasn’t about rescuing her, it was about getting the ship fixed, but you made a major personal sacrifice and gamble in what it took to achieve the aim. \n\nYou sense a little ambush is coming and agree it was a bad personal sacrifice and feel for what she went through, taking solace in the shared suffering. You tell her that saving her was a victory as well. Sarah lets out a little laugh with this and asks you whether the victor gets the spoils?  Not sure where to go with that comment you change subject and ask her whether she has a desire for revenge.  Sarah tells you that she wants revenge on Steven Maloney the guy who runs the kidnapping service, you have a grudge with him as well and wonder if the time going after him would be worthwhile, it won’t take long to find and….. painfully kill him?\n\nSarah tells you that there is nothing left on this planet for her, she wants to work with someone dangerous, someone with some power, and she wants to be the predator and not the prey. Prey end up in training centres she reminds you.  Sarah asks to join you, would work for you and be 100% loyal, if you want a lover she would do that, if you want someone to kill for you, she would do that. Sarah says that she would sleep with someone for you, give them the best sex ever. The only condition is that you train her to take care of herself, you help get the equipment she needs and that you give her a role in life. \n\nYou are now unsure, Sarah is a tough girl and has the mental qualities that would help you. You can’t tell if she would be loyal or not, but loyalty can be tested. Your biggest worry is her mental state, kidnapped, sexually abused, tortured and kept prisoner will have affected her deeply. Is she now infatuated with her rescuer?  You decide that you discuss it with Jane, and even her father. While normally you would care about the father’s view it would be good to know what Sarah was like before she was kidnapped. \n\nYou have a couple more drinks with Sarah, answering high level questions about your situation and asking some back. You are honest with Sarah saying that you will think about it, maybe you will give her a trial and that you will see what you can out about Steven Maloney. The last bit is a little bit of a lie, you know where Steven Maloney lives and you suspect that if he hears about the recent setbacks he won’t be at his club much. \n\nYou come to a conclusion, Sarah is a little bit fucked in the head, the whole way she has calmly rationalised your interests, how the training worked and taken it all in her stride without a visible breakdown says a lot. With the training during your conversations it is apparent she worked out the girls were processed into the docile sex slaves the rich wanted. But you will make a decision tonight, you tell Sarah this and tell her you will meet her back at her place later.\n\n[[Have a think|MArms4.1]]\n\n&lt;&lt;set $MArms to 6&gt;&gt;\n\n&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You head towards the Miners Arms but decide it is better to speak to Geoff first and get the Magnum repaired before hanging around the Miners Arms\n\n&lt;&lt;back&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Intel15.2" tags="" created="201507181921" modifier="twee" twine-position="5050,4910">As you walk away from the cafe excitement builds inside you. You have a way to get the Magnum repaired but it all depends whether you can find a girl who was kidnapped two weeks ago in a city of twelve million. \n\nYour first thoughts are to scour the brothels and other whore houses in the city but you think to yourself that the miner community has probably done that and sampled the goods. That leaves other options such as being sold as a slave to corporate executives which would mean extensive training and the girl is probably still with the gang. All you need to do is find the kidnapping gangs base of operations. You also hope that it actually is the Delta Cartel who have kidnapped her since you still have no proof. You need help with this so you call Mr. Grayson.\n\nMr. Grayson does not know if the Delta Cartel has the girl but 'understands' that they sell slave girls to the wealthy. Mr. Grayson can correlate the kidnapping reports and work out the locations where girls have been kidnapped. You then give Jane a call who listens then says she will get back to you. What she does is hacks Sarah Tranter’s e-mail account and identifies that Sarah was in contact with a man called Steven Maloney, Steven had promised Sarah a corporate career. You go back to Mr Grayson who tells you that Maloney is known for running a kidnapping and training service and that he’ll takes jobs for specific targets. Jane urges you to kill the filth, while Mr Grayson says that slave training is a lucrative business\n\n[[Figure out how to pull this off|Intel15.3]]</div><div tiddler="Int22.3B" tags="" created="201609060122" modifier="twee" twine-position="4630,6170">&quot;I’ll face off against your group of girl,&quot; you confidently respond causing Clawz to laugh at your decision.\n\n&quot;I promise not to mark your pretty face with my claws but I’ll make sure you’ll never forget me,&quot; she purrs in your ear before giving you one last smile and walking off. \n\nThe gang leader, says nothing, just releases your tit but when he walks off you hear him saying, &quot;he hopes you realize just how spiteful these girls can be.&quot; \n\nWhen they said a group of girls they were not joking as a full ten of them troop into the arena with Clawz at the lead. You had some hope that you might have been able to take out a few of them, maybe even come out on top, but against a full ten it looks a lot less likely. You still intend to make a good impression and won’t just to stand in the middle and let them attack you like a pack of snapping hyena’s\n\nYou take the fight the closest girl and quickly get the upper hand by delivering some brutal blows to her ribs. Another girl tries to pull you away and you throw her over your shoulder leaving them both on the ground. Then you hear a pop and see a set of small hooks hanging out of your abdomen. You look up and see a girl has shot you with a stun gun and you catch a gleeful expression as she cranks up the voltage and your muscles start to give out. You try and unhook it but lose control of your hands as you are shocked. \n\nThe girls quickly get control of you and you find yourself face down in the sand. Your pants are pulled down to your knees and your arms restrained. Your panties are then pruned off you by Clawz and slid over your face. \n\n&quot;Pretty fucked now aren’t you?&quot; sneers Clawz. &quot;Maybe I should leave a mark your ass now for being such a loser.&quot;\n\nYou say nothing since complaining it wasn’t a fair fight is pointless. You just grit your teeth in preparation for the sexual abuse that you’re expecting next; you’ve handled far worse. It doesn’t hurt that the rush off all of this has also given you a slight tremble of excitement, though that may be the adrenaline getting you ready for an escape attempt.

You use your finger to lubricate you’re your rear entrance before gently sliding the tip of your finger in causing you to bite your lip.

This will help you get used to having that plug in so we can have more fun later on.

You barely keep your composure as each new act makes your body shake as your ass contracts around the plug that fills it. Although your arousal reaches a fever pitch, you never manage to cum during the exercises but are all too eager to accept when Carla offers to let you keep the plug in on your way back to your apartment.\n\nMaybe you’ll have to wear it out some time...\n\n[[Return to your apartment|Apartment][$Days = $Days + 0.5]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC41&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;&lt;set $Mental = $Mental + 2&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Int22.3A" tags="" created="201609060122" modifier="twee" twine-position="4490,6170">&quot;I’ll take my chances against your men,&quot; you tell them resolutely.\n\nClawz laughs and tells you, &quot;You will be gagging on cock by the end of the day either way, little girl.&quot;\n\nThe gang leader smiles before giving your breast one last squeeze and leaves you in the arena. A large male in biker garb walks in, followed by more until there are four of them surrounding you. \n\n&quot;//This sure as hell isn’t part of their normal rules,//&quot; but then you remember that they mentioned special ones for you without describing them. If this is how they’re going to play you aren’t entirely sure you can win against four at once.\n\n&quot;Get your tits out,&quot; one of the men shouts.\n\n&quot;Suck my cock,&quot; taunts another.\n\nYou’re sure this is another tempt to test your willpower and see if you’ll just take the humiliation or risk a severe beating. You steady your nerves and make your decision as you charge towards the first biker with a jump kick. You connect solidly and send him tumbling back but it was not the incapacitating blow you were hoping for. The other three try take this opening to herd you towards the arena wall and try and reducing your space to escape. The fourth one begins getting back up and you know you are likely finished. A weapon is hanging on the wall that tempts you but you have a feeling you’ll end up worse for wear if you look like a coward that needs one. Your back now against the wall, you take a deep breath then lunge at the biker to your left.\n\nYou manage to land some blows but fail to break through and end up getting jumped by a biker who gets behind and tosses you to the ground. You try to get to your feet but you are pinned by the weight of one biker, joined by the rest until you are helplessly restrained by a biker on each limb.\n\nFinding yourself spread-eagled and pressed face first in the sand, you can kind of guess what is probably going to happen. Did they not want an alliance and just brought you here to be gang raped and murdered? You won’t beg for mercy since you know that will just encourage them and grit your teeth. If you find an opportunity to escape, you’ll have a chance to hunt the gang down and get your revenge.

You know they would have incapacitated Sarah before the shots were fired, so she will never know exactly what happened.\n\nYou exit the building and when you are some distance away Maddock’s men pull up a video feed of Delta Cartel's enforcers turning up to the facility and entering the building followed by an explosion. You’re told there will be no evidence of you or what has happened. They take you to a motel where you are shown to an unconscious Sarah Tranter. The motel has no permanent staff and its surveillance system was easily hacked so it made an ideal temporary safe house. You are told that Sarah’s shock will wear of in twenty or so minutes and with that Maddock’s team take their leave.\n\nAs you sit there waiting for Sarah to come around, you go through in your head what you want to say. She will recognize you from the camp, so that is one problem out of the way, but you aren’t sure she’ll trust you; she might even think this is a setup. Sarah is still naked from her time in the facility, now just covered by a blanket while she rests. You have been given a set of neutral utilitarian clothes by Maddock’s team in your size and are left a set for Sarah along with a box of tissues. You suspect most of those tissues will soon be in the bin when she tries to cope with what happened but your thoughts are interrupted by her finally stirring.\n\nThe whole thing goes surprisingly well with everything that happened.

You know they would have incapacitated Sarah before the shots were fired, so she will never know exactly what happened.\n\nYou exit the building and when you are some distance away Maddock’s men pull up a video feed of Delta Cartel’s enforcers turning up to the facility and entering the building followed by an explosion. You’re told there will be no evidence of you or what has happened and Shebo won’t want to be associated with the incident so they’ll stay quiet. They take you to a motel where you are shown to an unconscious Sarah Tranter. The motel has no permanent staff and its surveillance system was easily hacked so it made an ideal temporary safe house. You are told that Sarah’s shock will wear of in twenty or so minutes and with that Maddock’s team take their leave.\n\nAs you sit there waiting for Sarah to come around, you go through in your head what you want to say. She will recognize you from the camp, so that is one problem out of the way, but you aren’t sure she’ll trust you; she might even think this is a setup. Sarah is still naked from her time in the facility, now just covered by a blanket while she rests. You have been given a set of neutral utilitarian clothes by Maddock’s team in your size and are left a set for Sarah along with a box of tissues. You suspect most of those tissues will soon be in the bin when she tries to cope with what happened but your thoughts are interrupted by her finally stirring.\n\nThe whole thing goes surprisingly well with everything that happened.

Your escape is now a taxi and you quickly formulate a plan to reach it. You are not going to bother getting the head guard and disabling the sealed doors, as you have found a route out via the maintenance ducts and can open all the doors from this control room. These stun batons really are too overpowered.\n\nIt looks as if the guards have not thought about sealing down this route as none of the girls would ever find their way out. You quickly search the control room and find two pistols then head off to release Sarah Tranter, knowing that the guard’s keys can open the internal doors, just not the main exits.

Follow me, we are getting out of here,&quot; your muffled voice comes through the helmet.\n\nSarah gets up and you are not sure if she is going to attack you, ask more questions, or back down again thinking it is a trap.\n\n&quot;I’m a friend your Dad, Sarah. I took bounty request to recue you. Now, move your ass unless you want to end up like No.33!&quot; you bark at Sarah.\n\nThis does the trick and she starts to follow you hesitantly. Two rooms later she is entirely on your side when she spots a pair of restrained guards. You have to practically drag her off at the same time since she wants to gouge their eyes out. You lie to her and tell her she can get her revenge later, even though you will likely never see most of these sick freaks again.\n\nYou find your way to the maintenance duct entrance and crawl in, shutting the duct behind you. The next thirty minutes are spent crawling through endless tunnels, some pitch black, hoping you are making the right turns in the darkness. At points Sarah starts to worry and asks questions but you tell her to be quiet. Eventually you come out on the east side of the industrial complex you were kept in. It appears the slave operation was in the basement of some industrial facility. The taxi is three-hundred yards away on a main road and you quickly dash over with a naked Sarah intow.\n\nThere are no awkward questions as the taxi is computer controlled and the tinted windows hide your attire. You are grateful for this because you are going commando in an ill-fitting outfit and Sarah is totally naked. When in the taxi you rent a room in a drive in motel with automated check-in. A brief run to the room and a change into a bathrobe gives you just enough time to meet a motel member of staff delivering a clothing parcel. \n\nAfter you both shower and change you give briefly talk to Sarah and console her when she breaks down into fits of sobbing. You spend some time comforting the girl and you get the feeling she is a tough cookie but the events will leave deep scars. You help arrange for a fried of Sarah’s to pick her up from the motel, settle the bill, and say you will be intouch just before Sarah’s friend arrives. You are unsure whether you will be or not, but you think she needed to hear that. \n\nBefore you go, Sarah's hand lingers on your arm and she tells you that she would do anything for you and she doubts she would ever be able to properly repay you for saving her.\n\n[[Finish the mission|Mission 7 Debrief]]</div><div tiddler="FM4.1" tags="" created="201712222019" modifier="twee" twine-position="2390,6450">You plug the key in and the room goes into lockdown mode the blast doors shut and you hear the sound of the place being made airtight. \n\n“Greetings, Mistress” comes a neutral voice, “I have two urgent status reports for your immediate attention”.\n\nA tinge of worry hits you, hear you are sealed in a control room with what appears to be a computer core in AI mode. It will clearly know that you are not the Xena CEO, the inference from being called //mistress// gives that away, it has most likely seen through the stealth suit, well like human vision in that it has deduced that you are female.  You decide that you will sit in the chair and keep your steal suit helmet on in case it has some rules surrounding unauthorised personnel and the cryptokey.\n\n“Computer, update me please” you say, amused that your worry has made you well mannered!\n\n“Affirmative” comes the reply. It then tells you about the escape of the creatures and that activating several squads of droids will remedy the problem while leaving the Evictor garrison fit for task, you agree and the holographic feeds show a number of droids activating and marching off.  You watch with interest until your attention is taken away by the next status report.  The computer outlines that droid units are now in place to launch assaults on all jumpgates within 2 days, Xena and droid forces can seize full control of Evindium in that time as well as droid forces seizing the Hyperion and Odyssey.\n\nIt takes you a minute or so to absorb all of this, Xena seizing control of all jumpgates, would leave Xena in a massive position of control.  The majority, or all planets were dependent on interplanetary trade, the core worlds need additional food supplies and raw materials for there industrial base. While the new corporate worlds are dependent on selling raw materials to fuel their expansion, there were a number of newly settled worlds that are developed enough, but under populated that would be self-sufficient, but they were the exception to the general rule.   Seizure of the Hyperion and Odyssey, both the only jump capable military craft will reduce the Commonwealth’s options, and provide Xena with an ability to assault planets should any choose to destroy their jumpgates and go independent. \n\n“Computer, when is this plan going to be implemented?” you ask, wondering.\n\n“Stage 1 outlined, was due to be executed on arrival of the CEO, Stage 1 execution is now pending, awaiting your order” it responds.\n“My order”, you question, wanting to know who it thinks you are, or why it accepts your authority.\n\n“You are Celeste Blake, initial database searches link your Evindium visa application to a registered freight company.  Links past there indicate you and the other key shareholder are ex-military.  Either way you killed the CEO and took the cryptokey and now have full control, to answer the anticipated next question the CEO encouraged betrayal and my system design was agreed to be tied to the holder of the cryptokey. The outcome of you holding the cryptokey was not predicted, while a failed attack on the CEO in Evindium had a 95% probability, the CEO took the risk” the computer tells you.\n\n“Where does this leave me?” you question.\n\n“A wide question, the holder of the cryptokey has 1 million battle droids at their disposal and a varied selection of automated spacecraft.  There are several production sites on Evindium and numbers can be increased in short timeframes to meet strategic goals, the plan has an extremely high success rate, your predecessor intended to create an Empire, with him as Emperor”.\n\n[[Talk about the plan in more detail|FM4.1A]]\n[[Slump in the chair|FM4.1B]]\n</div><div tiddler="KG4.4B" tags="" created="201605282106" modifier="twee" twine-position="10,6170">Your comms chip was sending regular updates on the way to this dump, and even though you did not get a signal in here you totally expect Lina and Claire to either be close, or have found the place and got it under observation.

You ask Claire to buzz the main doors, hopefully the Head Guard will hope its reinforcements, if not you can possibly scare him into making a break for it. You get on the tannoy and make an announcement in the most deranged voice you can;\n\n“It is a prisoner escape, all guards please attend the punishment room for castration”, finishing with a cackle.\n\nYou then head off to release Sarah Tranter, knowing that the guard’s keys can open the internal doors, just not the main exits.

With a strong pang of regret, you suspect that Lina will kill the girls as well as wreaking the control room and any camera systems.

Now having visited the place, you can see the benefit, you need to own this place to send your enemies. Now kidnapping poor innocent girls, no, but scummy corporate execs, perfect.\n\nYou have two problems to this, dealing with the alarm and who could run the place.  &lt;&lt;if $Carla is 1&gt;&gt;Carla would be the best person, would she do it? Protected by a gang, and with a few guards to interrogate and then train it should be ok? Well you can only ask. &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Well the first problem is the alarm, you decide the first point is negotiation. You call Max and the Cobra’s and get them on their way, your comms chip updated Max to your location until you went underground and the Cobra’s have been on standby with a few vans. It amused you that the biker gang, had to use vans as the plan was to asset strip the facility. Max has found an alternative location. \n\nOnce you know the cavalry is on its way you radio the Head Guard and tell him that you work for another gang and you will offer him a deal, cancel the alarm and he can walk out of here alive. Otherwise he will die, you tell him all the guards are captured or dead, and you have the guns from the control room. You suspect he will only have a stun baton, after all who needs a gun to deal with a few female sex slaves in a secret location protected by the biggest gang.  The response is quick, the Delta Cartel will be here soon and that you will die very painfully, you reply that you are not worried about the Cartel, you want to strip the operation, but if you destroy it and kill a Delta response team, then that will be ok. You offhandedly remark that the guard will die in that situation, and has he not realized that the gangs are in near out and out warfare. You tell him you will meet him in the control room, if not he will end up dead.\n\nYou get no reply and you worry slightly but looking at the control room camera monitors you see the Head Guard and as you thought he is carrying no weapons. When he enters the control room he sees your gun and cancels the alarm, then starts begging for his life. You tell him he can go, knowing full well that by the time he gets to the exit, the Cobra’s will arrive. You smile to yourself about the double cross, it serves him right. You then call the Cobra’s and make sure they are in place, they are and you have a moment of doubt about your own moral stance. Fuck it, the guard made his living sexually abusing kidnapped girls, he deserves his fate.\n\nYou leave Max and the Cobra’s gutting the place and decide that you will not tell Sarah Tranter what is going on, too many questions could be asked. So, keeping the Cobra’s away you head over to her prison cell. You find Sarah in her cell and when you open the door in your ill-fitting guard’s uniform, she looks at you with suspicion. \n\n&quot;Get up.

I took bounty request to recue you. Now, move your ass unless you want to end up like No.33!&quot; you bark at Sarah.\n\nThis does the trick and she starts to follow you hesitantly. Two rooms later she is entirely on your side when she spots a pair of restrained guards. You have to practically drag her off at the same time since she wants to gouge their eyes out. You lie to her and tell her she can get her revenge later, even though you will likely never see most of these sick freaks again.\n\nYou find your way to the maintenance duct entrance and crawl in, shutting the duct behind you. The next thirty minutes are spent crawling through endless tunnels, some pitch black, hoping you are making the right turns in the darkness. At points Sarah starts to worry and asks questions but you tell her to be quiet. Eventually you come out on the east side of the industrial complex you were kept in. It appears the slave operation was in the basement of some industrial facility. The taxi is three-hundred yards away on a main road and you quickly dash over with a naked Sarah intow.\n\nThere are no awkward questions as the taxi is computer controlled and the tinted windows hide your attire. You are grateful for this because you are going commando in an ill-fitting outfit and Sarah is totally naked. When in the taxi you rent a room in a drive in motel with automated check-in. A brief run to the room and a change into a bathrobe gives you just enough time to meet a motel member of staff delivering a clothing parcel. \n\nAfter you both shower and change you give briefly talk to Sarah and console her when she breaks down into fits of sobbing. You spend some time comforting the girl and you get the feeling she is a tough cookie but the events will leave deep scars. You help arrange for a fried of Sarah’s to pick her up from the motel, settle the bill, and say you will be in touch just before Sarah’s friend arrives. You are unsure whether you will be or not, but you think she needed to hear that. \n\nBefore you go, Sarah's hand lingers on your arm and she tells you that she would do anything for you and she doubts she would ever be able to properly repay you for saving her.\n\n[[Finish the mission|Mission 7 Debrief]]\n&lt;&lt;set $Mission7Outcome to 1&gt;&gt;\n</div><div tiddler="Shebo Mission Start" tags="" created="201409281348" modifier="twee" twine-position="10,3930">Mr. Grayson told you that hostesses from the Shebo Show House are commonly invited to all the parties and social events in Evindium City. The good thing for you is this is a premiere club for the rich where girls and men act as a 'hostess'.\n\nHostesses will do everything from getting drinks and arranging tables to putting on ad-hoc shows for the clients when they feel like it. The key is for them to be exhibitionists and teases without ever actually selling their bodies. The logic is that clients will become infatuated and the demand for the girls will increase. This will allow them to be utilized as good all round entertainers, flirts, and the life and soul of parties. \n\nThe downside is that in order to become a hostess you need to be nominated and even then there is a test which is meant to sort the women from the girls. No-one will discuss what happens in this test. All you have heard are whispers that it is a test of endurance with a high failure rate.  \n\nYou head out to one of the premiere gyms to try and attract attention. Mr. Grayson tells you that this gym is owned by a director from Shebo and you will be brought to his attention as a potential candidate. It is quite clear to you that Mr. Grayson has contacts in all sorts of places.\n\nYou spot the Director in the room trying to look casual as he scopes the room out; it is time to impress.\n\n&lt;img src=data/gym6.png&gt; &lt;img src=data/gym7.png&gt;\n\nYou can tell that you have certainly gotten the director’s attention. You could try an intense routine to subtly show of your physique, keep your current pace and give him an eyeful later in the shower, or you could even just cut to the chase and ask him to follow you downstairs for whatever he likes.\n\n[[The subtle approach|Gym Option1]]\n[[The less subtle approach|Gym Option2]]\n[[The overly direct approach|Gym Option3]]</div><div tiddler="KG4.4A" tags="" created="201605282106" modifier="twee" twine-position="3230,6030">You call Maddock and explain the circumstances have reached a point where you do need assistance like you had warned him about. Maddock is clearly not overly happy about it but tells you he has dispatched a team because you are too valuable to his operation to become some mindless sex toy. His team is on standby to move since your comms implant had managed to successfully transmit the location earlier.\n\nWhile you are waiting for Maddock’s team, you collect the head guard who is not too far away. You hoist him by his neck and force his face against the scanner in order to cancel the lockdown. You then search the control room and find a set of pistols. They aren’t the best tech but they will be enough for you to kill an unarmored foe. You consider your options and work out a few contingency plans should Maddock’s team arrive late. \n\nYou begin to wake the head guard to interrogate him but Maddock’s team already arrives before you can start. You recognize a couple of members and even though his team is not in fancy gear they all move like pro’s to your trained eye. \n\n[[Approach the leader of the rescue team|KG4.4A1]]</div><div tiddler="FW3.2E" tags="" created="201612312032" modifier="twee" twine-position="3510,850">&lt;h3&gt;Evindium Fantasy Wear&lt;/h3&gt;\n&quot;Master, Master are you ok&quot; came the voice of ‘M’s favourite assistant, a medical device in her hand. \n\nThe girl was good thought ‘M’ once a leading Doctor, now a helpful assistant scanning his no doubt fractured skull. First aid equipment was great these days, a resin applied to cement the crack, though in this case by the dejected look on his assistant’s face there would be a trip to hospital. Like any good medical assistant, she was dressed in a slutty nurse’s outfit for his pleasure. Once she finished her emergency administrations ‘M’ sent her away.\n\nTwice now, he had messed up the procedure to make Celeste his. The first time was his fault, the difficulty was implanting the desire to please and obey, but keeping the underlying skills. It was easy to wipe them and leave little else, ok for sex doll purposes but keeping their skills intact and a good level of intellect was far better. ‘M’ recalled purchasing a sex slave from that training facility on planet, the girls were obedient, good shags but little above a sex robot in sophistication. \n\nSo ‘M’ had two pressing problems, apart from his head, firstly Celeste had resisted the programming, he had to know how and secondly Celeste was dangerous, she could be back to kill him, hopefully some of the programming had taken affect, but how much? It was too much, he had to close Fantasy Wear until she was dealt with. But he would enjoy the chase, it will now be a game of cat and mouse, he will hunt his prey and make her beg to be his slave, to make the thoughts go away.\n\nThe programming resistance he would have to report, the management would want to know, something he did not look forward to. Celeste would pay for that as well. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Back to the apartment|Apartment]]\n&lt;&lt;set $FW to 6&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Days to $Days + 2&gt;&gt;\n</div><div tiddler="Pussy Worship1" tags="Stat_41" created="201512240103" modifier="twee" twine-position="990,710">Carla stops your face close enough to her pussy that you can feel the warmth coming off it. She places her legs on top of your back, keeping you in place with only her pussy in your field-of-view. It is so... inviting. You want, no, you //need// to lick it. You start to move forward and are stopped by Carla's hand on your head.\n\n&quot;Now, now, Celeste. This is called Pussy Worship for a reason. I'm not just going to let you lap at my pussy, I'm going to teach you to eat it right.&quot; she says in a stern tone.\n\n&quot;You may begin by kissing and lightly nibbling my thighs and pubic mound but whatever you do, don't touch my pussy yet. I want you to take your time and get me properly dripping first. This way my pleasure will be that much more explosive later on.&quot;\n\nYou do as you are told and begin to plant kisses all over Carla's skin, careful to avoid her vulva. Although you know this is supposed to be building Carla's arousal, the aroma of her wettening sex is starting to make it harder to control yourself. Just when you think you can't take it anymore Carla speaks up.\n\n&quot;You're doing a great job, Celeste. I think it's finally time for you to eat me,&quot; she say, her voice clearly trying to mask her arousal at this point. You are about to dive in when she grabs you by the hair and stops you.\n\n&quot;//Gently// part my lower lips with your tongue, spreading it out as you lap up my delicious juices. Appreciate how generous and perfect a gift my pussy is to you...&quot; she trails off as your tongue goes to work. Taking things slower causes the full flavor of her juices to spread throughout your tongue. You enjoy the sweet taste of her nectar and enjoy the sensuality this slower approach brings to the act.\n\nAs you start to lose yourself in a self-imposed trance, Carla gently wraps her hands around your neck and slowly pushes your head deeper into her sex. You wisely take this as a clue to pick up your pace and begin lapping more rapidly. This is met by a long moan from Carla who then tells you to &quot;gorge yourself on her until she explodes.&quot;\n\nYou indulge your suppressed animalistic lust and begin to eat her more sloppily as you focus on making sure you get her lips and clit with each whip of your tongue. Her juices start to flow more plentifully when she suddenly wraps her thighs around your heads and shakes as she cums all over your face. You continue to lick her until her body stops shaking and she starts to come down from all of the pleasure.\n\nCarla takes one look at you, sees the makeup running down your face, and chuckles.\n\n&quot;You did an excellent job, Celeste. It doesn't surprise me in the least you are that talented at eating pussy,&quot; she says with a wink. &quot;Maybe don't wear so much makeup next time.&quot; \n\nYou both have a laugh before she has you get dressed and get ready to go. She lets you use a bathroom to wash your face off before you head back to your apartment.\n\n[[Return to your apartment|Apartment][$Days = $Days + 0.5]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC41&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;&lt;set $Mental = $Mental + 2&gt;&gt; </div><div tiddler="Dojo2C2A" tags="" created="201512202030" modifier="twee" twine-position="2110,1410">In the next round you delight in slashing her outfit to bits which exposes her breasts and nipples through the shredded fabric. Lina’s hakama is made to resemble a mini skirt as she rips off a trailing piece of fabric to prevent herself from falling again. You admire her lithe body, covered in sweat and minor lacerations from your sword strikes. Lina is not giving in without a fight and knows that by playing with her you have also given her a good chance to win the match.\n\nWhen Lina presses you hard you are forced to choose between between a quick death blow against her or risking your own defeat. You quickly cut her down and end the match causing the area to refresh. This time. Lina has slipped into a new ‘outfit’. You are taken aback as Lina has gotten rid of the computer generated hakama and kimono and is now entirely naked. You admire her form for a few long seconds until Lina speak up.\n\n&quot;Seeing how much you enjoyed exposing my body, I thought I would save you the trouble. See anything you like, Celeste?&quot; she states flatly, a sly smile on her face.\n\n&quot;Oh, I see a lot I like. It’s a shame I can’t enjoy unwrapping my present one last time,&quot; you reply.\n\n&quot;It is not over yet. I may have severely underestiamted you but let's change up the stakes: The forfeit all rides on this last match only. If you win, you’ll get to unwrap this present later. Too bad I’m not going to allow you to do that&quot; states Lina while readying herself. \n\nYou notice that she has taken a very aggressive stance with her legs spread out in a squatting position, sword raised high. Her raised arms puff out her chest making her pointed nipples pronounced and looking down between her legs you can see her lower lips are slightly parted.\n\nLina attacks in a big sweeping motion and you are forced on the defensive. You end up pressed against her, body to body, as you start to grapple. This is the major downside of fighting in these matches: No matter how realistic everything looks, the armour means that you can’t actually tease a naked Lina. All that really registers is the impact of a metal pole (your sword). \n\nLina is putting up a surprisingly good struggle and you really start to wonder what sort of enhancements she has. You toss Lina away from you and adjust your stance to prepare for a counter attack. Lina comes charging at you and you brace yourself to counter her strike. At the last second, Lina springs into the air with a flip and wraps her thighs around your head, pulling you to the ground while your face is buried in her virtual crotch. \n\nYou land on your back with Lina sitting on your face and are momentarily caught off guard due to a mixture of surprise, embarrassment, and arousal. As you move to try and shit Lina’s weight you feel a tap on your side and hear Lina laugh.\n\n&quot;If only you’d be so lucky that you would be graced with a sight like that before you actually die,&quot; she says clearly pleased with herself as she stands and helps you up. After you two bow to show your respects, she adds with a smirk, &quot;Don’t worry. You’ll get plenty of that view later tonight.&quot; You both leave the court and change out of the armour. You had agreed to meet Lina in the café when you are both ready and you find her sat at a table waiting for you.\n\nYou hold down a normal conversation but you can see the beginnings of reverence in Lina’s eyes; you may have lost, but you still nearly bested her and she respects you for it. The conversation culminates in an invitation to her father’s house to meet him. You are not sure about this but out of politeness agree. The conversation then moves onto the bet and Lina tells you that she has a small apartment in the Space Quarter she uses as a base of operations; there you will have some privacy. You agree to follow her and her apartment is only a ten-minute walk from Red’s.\n\nWhen you arrive at Lina’s apartment she asks you to wait in the lounge while she slips into something more comfortable. You admire a number of katana and other martial arts equipment on the walls. You are distracted from your admiration once Lina returns in a sheer, black dressing gown; a much worthier sight for your admiration. You can see the outlines of her nipples and what appears to be a triangular bush through the contrast of her skin and the dark fabric. \n\n&quot;Feel free to take a look at the blades. Some are real antiques,&quot; Lina informs you while leaning on a sofa. Her posture results in the dressing gown riding in tantalizing places. Curiosity gets the better of you and you pull a few of the blades down to look at. Lina stands back, watching your eyes, then stands up and walks over to a desk as you take a few swings to get the balance of the blades.\n\n&quot;Lina&quot; you say still swinging the blades, &quot;have you had any genetic enhancements?&quot; This question has been bugging you since earlier during your match.\n\n&quot;My answer will likely be the exact same as yours, my reckless sword mistress&quot; replies Lina. That answers one question but did Lina just address you as her mistress? Before you can think on it further, Lina continues. &quot;Student needs to punish you for bring very arrogant and reckless in fight, in real life you would be dead,&quot; she says sternly.\n\nYou noticed she now has a bundle of rope in hand after returning from the desk. \n\nYou struggle to keep a surprised look off your face.\n\n[[Be a good sport and submit|Dojo2C3A]]\n[[Try and talk Lina down from whatever she is planning|Dojo2C4A]]</div><div tiddler="Smugglers Intro" tags="" created="201511192126" modifier="twee" twine-position="150,4210">The problem is once you take a look around you notice that there is no-one at Neptune's's Bar apart from the bar hand. You had expected a bunch of rowdy mercenaries, killing time before they prepare to head out. You decide to ask the man behind the bar if he knows Billy. The barman at least looks the part for a mercenary joint; scarred, muscular, and with sleazy air about him.\n\n&lt;img src=data/nep6.png&gt;\n\n&quot;Hi ya,&quot; you open trying to sound serious, &quot;I'm an off world mercenary passing by and I hear there is a guy by the name of Billy who comes through here and offers work. This true?&quot; \n\nThe Barman looks you up and down then replies. &quot;I'm Billy and this is //my// bar. I run my business from here. If you want work, then you will need to leave your CV and I will go over any references, just so I know what I'm dealing with.&quot;\n\nTelling Billy that you were in the Special Forces is not an option. Troops of that caliber don't go looking for work at the bottom end like this, they work for first class mercenary units, and it would lead to more questions than you cared to deal with. You decide it best to just recount your early military days and tell him about your equipment. \n\n&quot;Terran Marine Recon, sir. I have a full, Class-2 armour set and assault rifle. Just passing through and a little bit of work pays for my space fare while looking for somewhere to settle. Not here though; this place sucks.&quot; Billy smiles and you assume he likes what you are saying.\n\n&quot;Hah! This place does suck and to be fair I could use a talented recon merc for a mission I got coming up,&quot; he says before looking you over once more.\n\n&quot;You know, very few of my team have Class-2 armour. If you can turn up in that I would be impressed enough. You’re not having me on now are you, miss?&quot; Billy continues.\n\n&quot;I can be armored up and ready to move in an hour depending on the departure zone. I doubt the metro would be happy to have armored people with guns wandered through,&quot; you reply, not biting about if you are joking.\n\n&quot;I like your style, brash and no nonsense attitude,&quot; Billy says with a huge grin, &quot;but I will be taking a huge chance on you if I take a stranger at their word and assume they don’t have poor intentions. Unless you can convince me otherwise, this is too risky. If you //need// the work, I’m sure my mind could be swayed if ya suck me off first.&quot;\n\nYou’ve known since you arrived at this bar that Billy's eyes have been roving all over you. You know his type both on the battlefield and off; if you turn up with armour, he will use you no matter what, if only just to make up the numbers. He can smell your desperation though and knows proper checks would take days and his eyes like what they see. Normally you would tell him to fuck off, but you need to go on this mission.\n\n[[Time to put on a show and tease him|Neptune's Show]]\n[[You're sure your oral skills could convince anyone|Neptune's BJ]]</div><div tiddler="SC99" tags="" created="201804052145" modifier="twee" twine-position="7990,2810">//The more Celeste thought about it, the more Carla's words burned themselves into her very soul.

Your change of clothing makes it near impossible to conceal a weapon but you doubt you’d want to risk angering the Cobras at this point.\n\nThe location they give you turns out to be a few buildings that form an arena that appears to be used for fighting. Based on the blood stained axe jutting from one of the walls by the entrance you’d have to say it was a pretty good guess at that.  You look around and spot no-one and decide to walk into the arena.\n\nIt doesn’t take long for the leader of the Cobras to comes out from of one of the buildings trailed by someone you don’t recognize. A glint of steel is seen from her hands and you wonder what she is carrying when you realize the reflection is coming from her fingers themselves.

You can feel the vibrations in the coffin and hear the girl’s yelps, when her punishment is over. The girl however is told to remain where she is and the man who caned her starts to fuck her. \n\nThis proceeds to be a bit of a gang bang as other men join in, the girl finds herself on her back, legs spread wide getting fucked and sucking another guy off as you remain directly under her ass, watching the juices splatter over the glass. You feel a heat filling your small room and a rising pressure in your loins to touch them, your nipples have stiffened but against all pressures you stay still. You let yourself focus on what is important and ignore the ass crack and moans above you.

Something soft glides across your clit unexpectedly, causing you to jolt as you opened your eyes to see Carla running the brush over your parted lips.\n\n&quot;Are you ready for the finale, Celeste?&quot; Carla askes as the brush head continued to toy with your needs. You looked up with wide, desperate eyes and nodded and watched as a small smirk grew across her face. \n\n&quot;Get ready to cum like you never have before, little slut,&quot; she said, increasing the pressure of her brush strokes. At the same time, the receptionist switched from a gentle massage to running the tips of her fingers up and down your soles as you thrashed against the table. Unable to suppress the building pressure any longer, you let out a load moan as your body began to spasm in the throes of orgasm in ways it never had before.\n\nYou come down from the bliss as Carla and the receptionist begin to undo the restraints and remove your gag. Carla helps you up onto shaky legs then walks you to the corner where you slide on your underwear and jumpsuit. On your way out the door, you realize your entire body feels like it just went through a fairly intense workout.\n\n[[Onwards to the next session|$CarlaOption1]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC41&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;&lt;set $Mental = $Mental + 2&gt;&gt;\n</div><div tiddler="CL1.6C" tags="Stat_96" created="201611071120" modifier="twee" twine-position="1550,6730">Mick’s hands envelop your butt cheeks, and then gives them a squeeze.  With still no resistance he pulls one hand off and slips it down the front of your pants and over your pussy, Mick then pushes your thong away and slips his finger into your sex. The other hand starts tugging down the back of your pants and helps give more access to the hand in front. \n\nMick then wriggles a finger into your butt hole which elicits a gasp from you, still holding the hug and pretending to be shocked. As his digits worm their way into you, you briefly wonder where this is going to lead. You really don’t want to fuck the odious man and are currently stopping yourself from lashing out, but the fingers do feel good and your pussy is reacting to the attention.\n\nAs it is you are saved by footsteps and voices in the corridor, Mick rapidly pulls his fingers out of you and you pull your pants up. You have nearly tucked your blouse in when the door opens and you are confronted with two barstaff. Their eyes show amusement when they look at you and one who knows Mick says should he have come ten minutes before, or after?  Mick laughs and say to guess but puts his juice covered finger in front of the guy’s nose and says to guess. The other female bar person looks at you and laughs and speaks “First night eh?”\n\nYou can’t tell whether the girl is implying you are a slag, or that this is normal behaviour for Mick. Either way Mick spends the rest of the night talking about going for a date, or going somewhere else quiet, or whether the bar staff will rat on him. You manage to get an agreement out of Mick that you will go on a date with him if gets you on the VIP team. Mick frets that if he gets you on the team you might renege on the offer but you say it is a gamble. Mick grumbles but says he will see what he can do, you can guess that he will be putting in a very good word for you. \n\n[[Onto the VIP search|CL1.7]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC96&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Training = $Training + 2&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Mental = $Mental + 4&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="CL1.6D" tags="Stat_95" created="201611071121" modifier="twee" twine-position="1690,6730">Mick readily agrees and you sink your knees and take the offered cock.

You don’t know but it does not take long and not wanting to get spunk down your top you swallow it all down. As it is you get a bit of dribble on you chine but wipe it off. You tell Mick that you need to head to the toilets and he lets you go, telling you where to meet him. When you go past the bar you feel the bar staff’s gaze on you, do they know, have they guessed or have you left something incriminating on your face.\n\nA little while later the act is a distant memory, but Mick is insistent that you must go on a date with him. Mick is busy pointing out girls in outfits he likes, saying you should wear similar when you go out.

You then stake out the changing rooms that the hired escort girls are being brought to. The next part is where you are slightly apprehensive, and this is joining them. What you know is the Dragon Gang get the girls delivered from various sources, and then dish them out. There is no set number and no strict security. You watch from a ventilation duct as the girls come in small groups, go to changing rooms, and then come out naked. \n\nWhen there is enough around, you crawl through the ventilation duct and drop into an empty changing room. You quickly pull off your jumpsuit and underclothes and put them in a locker. You mingle with the girls who don’t seem to know each other. Some look nervous, some not bothered but few are talking. You are left to hang around for 10 minutes or so when a few more girls arrive when a stern looking Asian lady turns up and appraises the twenty or so girls, she looks annoyed when the latecomers come rushing out of the changing rooms. These girls she demands stand to one side and remain where they are, the rest are asked to follow her.\n\nYou and the rest of the girls around the entertainment area and are given various jobs, you find yourself assigned to the ‘ornaments’ group. Your first role is to play a nude statue inside what looks like a glass coffin. There are around 10 of them scattered around a lounge and it is clear they are going to be used to put drinks on. Before you are assigned you are told that girls who move and wriggle will be publically caned, any girl who makes it through will be presented to the boss.\n\nAs the lid of your glass coffin is lifted you watch as the girls who were late come out dressed in short kimono’s and are taken to small side rooms, predictably with just a bed inside. You chuckle to yourself, all you have to do is lie still, and those girls will be fucked all night long. \n\n[[Wait for the party to begin|CL3.2]]\n</div><div tiddler="Intel6.2" tags="Stat_35" created="201512192026" modifier="twee" twine-position="5050,3370">You agree to do it and find that a smirking Phil has stood up and opened the door to the office for you. Clearly this was planned from the start as there are a lot of 'visitors' to the office, all of which are standing around and waiting.\n\n&quot;Get on your knees and start crawling then, Ms. Blake. I will tell you where you need to go,&quot; commands Hector.\n\nReluctantly you get down on your hands and knees and start crawling out of the office. You are painfully aware that your dress has started to ride up with the crawling and before long your bare crotch will be exposed for everyone to see. \n\nAs you crawl out of the office, you know people can see your pussy by the catcalls and comments that are shot your way. All you is do is look down at the floor and crawl faster to get this over as soon as you can. Hector gives you the directions and you do a full circuit of the office with your dress around your hips. A complete crawl of shame and you know it is not over yet. \n\nWhen you get back to the office you are told to strip off your dress and you do so. With no bra on you find yourself stark naked in a glass office with Hector completing the required paperwork and glancing up to admire your body. You glance around and see that there are a sea of spectators all looking through the glass walls and you feel ashamed and aroused at the same time. You hear the quiet and familiar sound of your wet lips opening and hope no one notices how turned on you are.\n\nAfter nearly ten minutes of standing there in this state Hector tells you that the paperwork is complete and approval for the funds transfer has been granted.\n\n&quot;Well Ms. Blake, thank you for being a good sport. The staff have really appreciated a complete slut like yourself providing us with such fine entertainment. You can have your dress back when you get outside.&quot; \n\n&quot;B-But...&quot; you stutter, with a mixture of rage and humiliation.\n\n&quot;No buts, except for your naked one, Ms. Blake. You are in no position to argue and you know it, just be glad we have an agreement and I’m a man of my word,&quot; sneers an amused Hector.\n\nWith no choice you turn around and walk out of the office. As you slide on your high heels on the way out you receive a big cheer. Phil walks behind you holding your dress and you have another walk of shame across the office floor. As you reach the lift, Phil gives a squeeze of your butt to a big cheer from the office floor. Once inside the lift, Phil just stands back and admires your naked form.\n\n&quot;Boy, I so want to just fuck you in this lift&quot; he states, the bulge in his pants giving his intentions away.\n\nYou don't reply, praying he doesn’t notice you’re already wet. After a few seconds, the lift doors open out into the reception area. As you step out of the lift, there are a number of gasps from the visitors in the building. You just ignore them and walk to the exit with a laughing Phil trailing behind you.\n\nAs you exit the building, Phil chucks you your dress which you quickly pull on to a few bemused and shocked faces from people passing on the sidewalk. You quickly walk off and hail a taxi. \n\n&quot;Fuck!&quot; you scream as you close the door and the taxi pulls off. You just wanted to stab your heels into the smug faces of Hector, Phil, and all of the fucking bastards in that office. \n\n[[Return to your apartment|Apartment]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC35&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Mental = $Mental + 4&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Int6 to &quot;Complete&quot;&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Credits to $Credits + 1000&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Days = $Days + 0.5&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Intel6.3" tags="Stat_36" created="201512192138" modifier="twee" twine-position="5190,3370">&quot;There is no way in hell I am parading around on all fours in this dress while I’m not wearing panties! You’re insane,&quot; you tell a clearly disappointed Hector.\n\n&quot;Well Ms. Blake, this is rather unfortunate. I thought an exhibitionist slut like yourself would jump at the chance. Now we have to do things the hard way: I can either call the planetary authorities and alert them that you are suspect or you can fuck me and Phil in one of the more, shall we say, private offices.&quot;\n\nYou don't really have a choice here so you nod slightly, pissed off with yourself. Fucking Phil, the overweight, slimy clerk and his snide, idiot of a boss repulses you but you need the funds and putting you under investigation will ruin your mission. This is classic blackmail.\n\nPhil leads you out of the office to a sea of disappointed faces. It is quite clear the staff expected or at least hoped that you would crawl past waving your pussy in the air like some cheap harlot. The irony is you will soon be getting used like some cheap harlot in a few, short minutes. Phil leads you to a cleaner’s cupboard where he tells you to pull up your dress and expose yourself.\n\n&quot;I knew it! I knew it!&quot; Phil says all excitedly as you feel like a naughty girl. You stand there holding your dress up at your hips as Hector walks in and gives you a wolfish grin.\n\n&quot;The boss goes first, Ms. Blake. Lie back on that desk over there,&quot; says Hector fumbling with his zipper.\n\nYou look over your shoulder and spot the desk and do as you are told. You hitch your dress up, lay on your back, and spread your legs which further exposes your now wet pussy. Hector comes over and grasps the top of your thighs and positions his cock at the entrance to your pussy. He takes one long look at you and then guides his cock to your ready hole. With an amused smile, he slowly fucks you as he savors the moment and takes his time.\n\nHis thrusts get harder and he places his hands just above your butt cheeks to keep you from sliding away from him. Eventually he finishes inside of you and pulls out to a really happy Phil who has been spitting out encouragement all the time by saying things like &quot;Fuck the slut!&quot; and &quot;Give it to her!&quot; like an armchair spectator. As Hector sorts himself out and tucks his shirt back in, Phil chucks you a cleaners rag and tells you to clean yourself up and then bend back over the desk. \n\nYou bite back a retort that Phil wants you that way so his belly does not stop the action but say nothing and adopt the position with your ass up. Hector gives you a smack on the ass and leaves his parting words that the bank transfer will be //coming// for you and probably before Phil does. His sarcastic tone implies that Phil will take forever. You hear the door close and Phil’s sweaty hands on your hips and his belly on your lower back. You then feel his cock by your pussy lips and Phil removes a hand from your hips to guide his dick inside of you.\n\nAs it slips inside, Phil mutters to himself, &quot;I’ve dreamed of this every night since our last meeting. I’ve wanted to fuck you so bad, Ms. Blake. I thought I was going to really have to save up and come to your brothel and give you an offer you could not refuse. Now I get to have you for free!&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah... Sloppy seconds,&quot; you mutter to yourself. Phil either does not hear you or deliberately chooses not take notice as his hands slip past your hips heading towards your tits. As he slowly fucks you, he starts to maul your tits and pulls them free of the dress. He also demands that you make some noise like a good whore and you start moaning and telling Phil to fuck you, and that it feels so good. The problem is that acting is only covering up your real problem; being used like this is really getting you off and you are close to orgasm. You start to replace your fake cries with natural moans as the fucking continues and your body gets closer to climax.\n\nPhil looks into your glossed over eyes and says, &quot;Holy shit. Are you actually going to cum for me?&quot; \n\nThe humiliation of this question causes your body to surrender and you orgasm hard to a super excited Phil.\n\n&quot;Oh my god! I fucked you proper bitch and you fucking loved it!&quot; he shouts as you buck your still spasming pussy back onto his cock. \n\nOnly your moans manage to leave your mouth in response to his degrading remarks and soon Phil squirts a huge load inside you. As he pulls out of your twitching hole, he contnues to cum all over your lower back and ass.  \n\n&quot;Come and clean my cock off, baby,&quot; he commands. You obediently climb off the table and with your dress in a mess and your tits out, you start to lick and suck his rapidly deflating cock. As you finish up and look at Phil he compliments you on your skills as a whore and turns around to sort himself out. You repress a desire to end his miserable life but know it is not worth the risk.\n\nShortly afterwards you are shown out of the office by Phil and enter the lift on your own where you are deposited into the reception. You quickly leave the building and get a taxi. The only good thing to come out of this is that Hector stuck to his word approved the credit transfer.\n\n[[Return to your apartment|Apartment]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC36&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Mental = $Mental + 2&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Training = $Training + 1&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Int6 to &quot;Complete&quot;&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Credits to $Credits + 1000&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Days = $Days + 0.5&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Random RL1" tags="" created="201504272122" modifier="twee" twine-position="5610,4350">The [[metro]] is the best form of transport on planet: fast, cheap, and safe.

A couple of times you feel a hand brush your ass and you ignore it. On the third time it happens you glance around to look for the person who is doing it. As you search, you see a metro security officer looking you in the eye. You hold the officer's gaze for a second and give a neutral expression.\n\nYou look forwards again and think that it has been dealt with. You take time to consider your conflicting emotions: one part of you is clearly excited by the attention but the other part is a little irritated by the act.

When you make pleasant conversation, she seems to relax, you tell her that the two most gossiped about people at the party are now together she laughs. All eyes are on you both and you take another glass of Champaign from the waiter. You tell Sarah that you have been asked to help get a picture of her tattoo, or just to get a few embarrassing shots. Sarah is drunken enough not to go ballistic but she is clearly worried. You re-assure her that you work for the better money and a few credits is not what you are about, you ask Sarah how many credits would she pay to engineer a better solution for her. \n\nThat clearly strikes a nerve and Sarah gestures for you to join her in a quiet corner of the Lounge and she steers you over there by your arse, quietly telling you that it will give the gossipers something to talk about, touching up the number one guest and that senior management has its advantages. When you get to the quiet corner Sarah asks if this is a joke but you tell her you are deadly serious, that you work in Shebo for advantage and nothing else. Sarah chokes back any comments of what she thinks about Shebo girls but says that public humiliation of Helen is what she wants. The best solution being her fiancé being caught in the act with another woman. The best opportunity would be a big do coming up, Helen’s wealthy parents have splashed out on a pre-wedding event and Sarah knows how you will get a ticket.\n\nThe solution is simple, all you have to do is pull up Sarah’s dress, exposing the tattoo to everyone. You ask about the embarrassment but Sarah says the risk is worth it. You talk next about payment, this is crunch time as you don’t want credits you want access to the mainframe. Sarah would not want anyone having privileged access to the mainframe in case the system got taken down, read only access is a different matter but from speaking to Maddock all he needs is someone with access to the mainframe, he can hack it from that stage. So you come in to say that you want to get a colleague into a job where they have read only access to the data. Sarah looks at you intently and says a lot of people try to pay bribes to get access to information but all access is audited, it would be easier if you bribed one of the techs. You say that you don’t want anyone to know what data is being looked at. Sarah looks at you as if she is missing something and then agrees, saying that she is owed a favour. Sarah then tests the waters around the danger of Helen getting revenge, you say that if you come out of the party alive it means you have the right connections. Sarah takes this hint very quickly, you basically said that if she holds out on her side of the deal things could get a lot worse. It is a big risk for her, but being fired on Evindium is not something she wants and revenge is a very personal motivator. \n\nYou then split up with Sarah and wait until the party announcements and mingle. You quite happily tell people that the awards ceremony at the end of the party will go out with a bang. As the party comes to an end you are invited to be a fellow hostess where Sarah gives out awards to the management team.

Chris looks stunned and freezes for a moment before quickly regaining  his composure. He then walks a few feet then makes an announcement.\n\n&quot;Lads,&quot; he says in a rushed tone. &quot;Dad is calling on my chip so you need to scoot before he figures out we are all in here.

You'd bet all your credits his mind is flooded with thoughts of taking you and fucking you doggy-style over the back seat.

Chris decides to sit in one of the other independent chairs in the back of the vehicle.\n\nYou ask Chris about the features of the car and send the order to the bug to deploy itself. Chris talks you through the amenities provided by the car; it would put some spacecraft to shame with its complexity. Chris is clearly obsessed with the car but his conversation soon comes back to what got you here in the first place.\n\n&quot;So, uh, how old were you then?&quot; Chris asks. &quot;When you lost your virginity, that is.&quot;\n\n&quot;I was fifteen&quot; you reply, giving him a warm look.\n\n&quot;What was he like? Chris enquires with a gulp, an eager look shining in his eyes.\n\n&quot;He was an older man, my senior by a good decade or so. I have //always// preferred older men or the company of women,&quot; you add with a grin.\n\nThere is a silence between you and Chris while he tries to recover his thoughts from this unexpected surprise.

I need to let off some steam, but this isn’t over yet. You know you can’t resist me forever.&quot;\n\nYou wonder whether he will scream your name when he is fucking her.

You are not sure if you want to get revenge or just let him have his way with you for a second time. Today it is your lucky, or unlucky, day as you see the security officer with a colleague on the station platform. After glancing over at them, they follow you onto the metro. You don't know what you are thinking as you know you could have slipped by unnoticed and instead you have brought this onto yourself.\n\nYou get on at the back of the carriage and are aware of the security officers arrive shortly after. The train is quite crowded but the crowd parts for the security officers as best as they can. The familiar one steps behind you and his colleague steps around to your side so he is visible in your peripheral vision. You make eye contact with another woman who is watching the security officers and you. You note that she looks relieved when the security officer stops behind you. You feel the familiar feeling of the officer’s hand upon your butt again and you let out a tiny pant. Your body reacts even faster than the last time and after a few rubs you are already getting wet, but his hands don't stay on your ass for too long. You feel them start sliding upwards; reaching for your breasts.\n\nYou don't offer any resistance and the hands move onto your breasts, cupping and massaging them. Your gaze locks onto the woman in front of you who does not know whether to stare or look away. You enjoy looking at her and feeling her discomfort. Judging by her nipples poking out of her shirt she is aroused by the situation in a perverted, voyeur-like fashion. As your thoughts wander, you wonder how it would feel to put on a sex show on this train with yourself at the centre of it.\n\nYou lean back onto the security officer that is cupping your breasts and the other officer steps forward and puts his right hand on your butt as the other hand gently rubs your groin. Subconsciously, you lean back even more and rub your groin against the stranger’s hand. The security officer to the front of you then leans forwards and gives you a long, lingering kiss which leaves your breath ragged. It's only when you have a mild orgasm from the security officers feeling you up that you regain some of your composure. \n\nYou can see a few people around you staring and murmuring and you are quite sure they have noticed what has happened. Having reached your stop, you disengage from the security officers and are followed out of the train. \n\nOne security officer taps you on the shoulder as he passes and says,  &quot;Take my number. I think you’ll want it. Feel free to call if you need my //services// again.&quot;\n\nYou take the number and scurry off, acutely aware of the dampness between your thighs. You wonder about how you have been feeling lately.

Chris then suggests you climb in the car and as you do so he slaps your backside causing a surprised yelp from you. \n\nChris follows you into the car and you spot an eager erection in his trunks. You look pointedly at his very visible bulge and then hold his gaze. \n\n&quot;You know what I want you to do,&quot; Chris says as he whips out his cock and stares at your lips. You take your time, building up his excitement, until you eventually take his head in your mouth. As you are sucking him off, you are taken by surprise as Chris’s mates have returned and have opened the doors on both sides of the car.\n\nThe one behind Chris just laughs but the one behind you pulls your bikini top aside and starts fondling your breasts. Before you have time to think or react, Chris places his hand on the back of your head and tells his mate to fuck you. Since you are already on hands and knees, a quick untying of your bikini bottoms exposes your slick pussy to the lad, who wastes no time in stuffing his cock in.\n\nYou are getting fucked doggy style while sucking Chris’s cock when he spurts inside your mouth and lets his other mate take his place. You continue to get spit roasted when the one you are sucking off says he wants a shot at your pussy. Taking advantage of the situation, you activate one of the bugs inside the car while they switch places.\n\nBy the time you feel the rush of the other two lads' cum fill both of your holes, the bug is in place and secure. Chris and his mates offer you no way of cleaning yourself up as they head back to the swimming pool and the best you can do is wipe their cum off with your hands and hope no-one notices when you reach the pool.\n\nYou go for a quick swim but you can tell by the looks you are getting that everyone knows about what just happened in the garage. \n\n[[Spend the evening at the pool|PB4.4]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC51&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $pbs = $pbs + 2&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Mental = $Mental + 1&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Training = $Training + 2&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="PB4.2" tags="" created="201602072052" modifier="twee" twine-position="2530,7010">&lt;&lt;set $carbug to either(1, 2, 3)&gt;&gt;&quot;I have to admit, this car is surprisingly clean,&quot; you say as you look it over. &quot;How do you manage to keep it like that on such a dusty planet like Evindium?&quot;\n\nThis gets Chris’s mates talking and before he turns to you with a child-like grin.\n\n&quot;The lads and I were thinking maybe you could clean it,&quot; he says as they all look over your figure in the bikini. &quot;It is a bit dirty if you look really closely.&quot;\n\n&quot;I don’t think it’d be right for your bodyguard to do something like that,&quot; you say playfully, causing Chris to grimace a bit.\n\n&quot;That’s fine,&quot; he says trying to downplay his disappointment, &quot;One of my mates can go grab few girls who are game for it.&quot; One of his mates walks off and says he'll be back in a second.\n\n&quot;You know that you will be the odd one out. Or did your sense of fun disappear once you turned thirty?&quot; Chris chides in an attempt to work you up. You feign shock and pretend to reluctantly agree to join in.\n\nSure enough, within a couple of minutes, one of his friends returns from the pool with a two girls intow. They also made sure to grab some cleaning equipment in the form of a hose, three buckets, and several large sponges. Chris takes control of the hose and the fun starts as he hoses all the girls down, including yourself.\n\nYour wet bikini is virtually see-through as you set to scrubbing the car with your sponge. In the background of everything happening, a bug scuttles from your bag towards the car. A few times it is exposed, but you slap the ass of one of the girls cleaning the car. This helps distract everyone and helps assert your position as the most intimidating person around.&lt;&lt;if $carbug is 1&gt;&gt; You almost howl inside when one of Chris’s mates accidentally steps on the bug, wincing as he tries to find what he stepped on.\n\n&quot;Eh, just a stray bit of metal in here,&quot; they squeal, throwing the wreaked bug into the corner of the garage. \n\nThe car is now sparkling clean and the novelty of bikini clad babes cleaning the car is wearing off. You know your opportunity has been lost.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; After a few more minutes, you manage to finish cleaning the car as the bug locks in position. \n\n&quot;Ok, Chris, you've had your fun, but we need to get back to the pool before anyone else realizes we were in here,&quot; you tell him.

First of all, you tell Carla that you are one kinky bitch, this drops the tension as Carla knows that all too well.  The you tell her you a business woman, and that an ongoing business matter has kept you on Evindium.  Carla asks whether your business involves killing people, and if she is allowed about who you work for.\n\nYou don’t fully trust her, but have plenty of blackmail material so you tell her that you’re basically a freelance, but rely on repeat business, so your destiny is tied to other parties. But you want to broaden your horizons, and you like Carla, and feel that you could form a mutually beneficial working relationship. You then talk about killing, and simply briefly that the gang members are not the first you have killed, they won’t be the last either.  Carla is then quite quiet for a few minutes and then asks you about the proposed business model, Carla is quite tentative about is, wondering if she has exchanged one form of blackmail to another. \n\nYou tell her, that for now things will remain the same. Carla needs to maintain the business and keep paying off Lenny. Now that the street gang will be busy, Carla won’t have to worry about paying them. If they come back you will deal with them, or stake up the money to pay Lenny off. Carla is not stupid, she has not thanked you as the deal is totally staked in her favour, until you say what you want. You tell Carla that you are taking a gamble, a small gamble that Carla will be able to return the favour. The crux of it is that you likely have some opportunities for Carla, and that you will tell her the risks involved, knowing full well that Carla is someone used to risks and using people. \n\nCarla agrees, to be honest she knows she has little choice but on the face of it, the benefit is mainly in her favour. Carla does set one rule though, she is the domme and she is not going to become your submissive sex toy. This brings a laugh from you, you need her to be a dominant devious person, you don’t want to break her and laying down a challenge you tell her that she can’t break you.\n\nThe discussion following that touches the experiences you have shared, you get the feeling Carla is trying to suss you out and get more information from you. All you give her is that you live off planet which says that you have a lot, lot, lot more money than Carla, and possibly more than Shaun’s family.

You look around but see no changing rooms or panel screens.\n\nCatching your roving eyes Giannio’s male assistant says, &quot;I’m sorry, miss, but we have no changing room here. Most clients don’t mind and we are perfectly professional here.&quot;\n\nBefore you have a chance to reply Giannio interjects, &quot;Come on, Celeste, darling. I must see you in this dress. I believe it will look simply gorgeous on you!&quot;\n\nYou realize that Giannio’s main interest is his design, not seeing your naked body, so you start unzipping your jumpsuit. While Giannio is busy with the dress you notice that the two assistants are watching you strip down to your underwear. Looking at the design of the dress you decide to remove your bra and put on a bit of a show for the assistants by slowly pulling it off and making no effort to hide your breasts. If they were going to stare at you, you might as well show of your amazing natural figure.\n\nGiannio turns arounds and notices your practical underwear and loses it. &quot;Darling, darling, darling! You can’t wear those horrid things in the Lounge,&quot; he exclaims with bravado. &quot;I will have to get you some proper underwear but that may take me hours!&quot;\n\nThe female assistant steps forward and whispers something in Giannio’s ear.\n\n&quot;Wonderful, simply wonderful! It seems that the disaster has been averted! Celeste darling, my lovely assistant Lina will lend you hers. She has excellent taste in lingerie and this means we can be back at the Lounge in no time. I can’t wait to show my creation to everyone and introduce you to my friends!&quot;\n\nLina holds your gaze and hitches the hem of her dress up to reveal a skimpy pair of laced silk panties. Without breaking your gaze, she slowly pulls her panties down exposing her neatly trimmed patch of pubic hair and the delicate lips of her vulva to your view. She then lifts her leg to pull her foot out of the panties, making sure that you get a full view of her parted lips which are noticeably wet. Your eyes dart between her legs and she gives you a triumphant smile before stepping forward and lifting her other leg to pull the panties free and then offers them to you.\n\nThis would be the first time you had borrowed someone’s used panties and after the show she put up for you, you were feeling a bit off balance and feel a familiar warmth between your legs.\n\n&quot;Th-thank you Lina. I’m not really used to borrowing other girls’ panties but I can hardly turn down such a generous offer. Would you mind hanging on to them while I try on the dress first?&quot; you ask with a bit of a flush.\n\n&quot;Certainly miss,&quot; Lina smiles back.\n\n&quot;Splendid,&quot; Giannio exclaims, &quot;Now I just need you to step on this platform so the scanner can take your measurements, love. My eye is usually superb but I still have to check.&quot;\n\nYou step on the platform which starts to slowly spin you for the benefit of the scanner’s beam.

This was never about the smugglers, it was about setting the mech to run amok for this Maddock. You idly wonder whether Mr. Grayson was in on this or if he just used this 'opportunity' to get you in with the smugglers. CCTV footage and logs from the mech won’t implicate you but the hack and subsequent code change may leave some traces that could.\n\nThe Xena Corp executive who lost his son was the Head of Security you know Maddock probably targeted the son. Any sense of coincidence quickly disappears from your mind. All you achieved today was meeting up with the smugglers and providing a potential investigative lead; you were used as a sacrificial lamb, no more. This situation and the lack of coincidence is not lost on the smugglers either.\n\n&quot;Well, Celeste, you got us through the tunnels and that merc guarding the exit never knew what hit him. I'm impressed and I wouldn't want to get on your bad side,&quot; states the Smuggler leader with full sincerity. &quot;I guess that this was all just an opportunity for Maddock to lash out at the corps and get at the bigwigs. Life won't be easy for us in the short term but we have Maddock to thank for being alive. &quot;And you too, of course,&quot; he quickly adds. &quot;My name's Tyrone and I owe you one&quot;. \n\nIt is clear that the smugglers believe Maddock and yourself were behind everything, but the bare you no ill will. You guess they are used to being pawns in other’s schemes. You continue to chat and say that you will be intouch someday to call in a favour for saving their lives. Tyrone gives you a comm code where they can be reached. \n\nIt is time to move on and with reluctance you decide that you have no choice but to leave your armour and rifle here with them. You don't trust them enough to give them the location of your apartment, nor can you simply walk through the streets with it.

Taking small steps backwards you crumple to the floor once your far enough away from the edge to feel comfortable.\n\nIt seems to take a long time for you to get control of yourself, to get your breathing under control. To stop the shaking, the unusual feeling of uncontrolled fear, something with your experience and implants you never expected to see, not on heights at least.\n\nSometime later you are still in the same spot, you can't remember how you got here. Your last memory was in your apartment, but you know you have travelled some way to get here, it must have been a taxi and using your comms chip you put in a request for recent transactions. The answer chills you to the bone, you put in a request for a taxi and paid for it. You just can't remember it..........\n\nAs you depart the rooftop you are sure you know the answer, killing that girl has had consequences. The news sites warned you that people who have been a little vocal about brainwashed friends have either gone quiet, or have been involved in tragic accidents or suicide. You don't think you are cracking up and implant diagnostics can detect sleepwalking or similar affects. Diagnostics say you were ok and your cold reasoning tells you that you have a kill switch. They have hypnotised you to either take your life, or wake up on the edge. Both disturb you as was it some sadistic game for you to wake up on the edge when lots of people would have fallen anyway? Did they mean for you to live, do you have another compulsion, will it repeat itself?\n\nAs you take a taxi back to your apartment you can't shake the feeling, are you going to die? Are you in danger of trying to take your life at some random date or time interval, some trigger? The pressure is getting to you and you feel a strong migraine coming along.\n\nWhen you get back to your apartment the answer becomes clear, there is a message in your handwriting on the plastic wall. Red lipstick on a mirror reads;\n\n//I’m going to kill myself sorry. I can’t live with murdering that poor girl in the Red Light District……//\n\nWhile you are looking at it Jane calls and tells you that you have received an email, that worries Jane.

Come to the Excelsior clinic tonight at 19:00 hrs. They will be expecting you//\n\nThe sick feeling in your stomach is that you know for a fact that you have a command line in your head that is going to meet that threat. Unless you are locked away in a cell, at some point you have no doubt it will happen. You know the only option is to see this through to its conclusion, one way or another. They must want something, it can't just be to humiliate you, there has got to be some way out of this situation.\n\nYou tell Jane that you will go, that you don't to talk to her right now.

For this occasion all the gang members in the HQ are required to attend, some look bored, some look angry and others are barely there due to the sheer amount of alcohol. A no show would be an insult. \n\nYou are still naked and are introduced as the whore who insulted the leader, then challenged him to a duel. This proves amusing to all and the laugher and catcalls go on for some time. This seems to have improved the mood of the Dragon Gang leader and he speaks to the crowd, saying drinking, fucking and killing are the greatest pleasures. \n\nYou are handed a katana and start to shake, pretending to be nervous which brings another roar of laughter from the audience. The Dragon Gang leader shouts to the audience, he tells them you have asked for a duel hoping for a quick death, but he has the skill to make you eat those words. \n\nAs the duel starts you nervously ask that if you win or put up a good show you are allowed to walk out of here and create another round of laugher. The Dragon Gang leader orders his gang to let you walk out of here alive, which again makes the audience laugh and scream that you are insane. 45 seconds later and the silence in the room is acute, the fight was very short and the Dragon Gang leader is dead. His blood has sprayed all over your skin and your katana took part of his head clean off. Half the room are in complete shock, the other half now know this was an assassination and look round the room trying to work out who arranged it. \n\nYou drop the sword in the arena and walk out, no-one blocks your way and as you leave you hear the starts of arguments inside.

Neither seems a viable option, so you try the only solution a girl has. You hold his gaze and remain where you are while looking unimpressed.\n\nThe guard approaches you with an evil grin before saying, &quot;We meet again my dear. I wasn’t so impressed with your big mouth last time.&quot; The security officer looks a bit sheepish as his companion laughs.\n\nFeigning ignorance you reply, &quot;I don't know what you are on about.&quot;\n\nThe Security Officer shakes his head at you, &quot;Don't play coy with me. You touched me up, got me all excited and told all the passengers about me being aroused. You are going to pay for that.&quot;\n\nStill keeping up your pretense you use your best confused looking expression and say, &quot;I don't know what you are talking about. Seriously, I've never even seen you before!&quot;\n\nThe other security officer laughs at this and the other one goes a little red in the face, &quot;Someone recorded you shouting and I've got a copy. I also wouldn’t forget a face like yours. Now, turn around and place your hands against the wall. I believe you’re in possession of a concealed weapon and you will need to be searched.

You wonder if it is because seh thinks you might end up working here? Not in a million years you think, even if you didn't have your current problems. \n\nWhen you enter Carla's office you see her sat at her desk, absorbed with a computer screen. You lift a bag containing the lingerie set you bought from beside you and set it down on Carla's desk.\n\n&quot;I think it's time I prove I'm ready to try my hands at doing this. I picked that out as the base of my outfit. Does it work?&quot; you excitedly ask Carla.\n\n&quot;My, my. Down girl,&quot; she responds and laughs, taking her attention from the computer screen. &quot;I actually have one of my timider footboys named Pete coming by. He's a smaller, older gentleman and he gives the best massages. I'd hope that would be up to your competency.&quot;\n\nYou both have a laugh and then she grabs your bag and tucks it under her desk.\n\n&quot;I'll hold on to this until you've earned the title of Domme around her. I'll even buy you a pair of heels or boots to go with them,&quot; your face lighting up at her incentive. &quot;Now go get changed and get comfy in the armchair in the red room. Pete will be by with me soon.&quot;\n\nTwenty minutes later you are changed and just finding a good spot when the door opens and Carla brings Pete in. He is already stripped down to his socks, a pair of boxers, and a t-shirt and kneels before you.\n\n&quot;Miss, may I massage your beautiful feet?&quot; he asks with the faintest of grins.\n\n&quot;You may,&quot; you offer while tilting your head up slightly to look down on him.\n\nHis hands go straight to work and you feel the stress of your current predicament melt away as they work their magic. You close your eyes for what you believe is a few seconds but must have been longer since Carla is gone when they open. You look down to see Pete is already kneading your other sole, and his boxers are now straining to hide his erection.\n\nYou smile and purr, &quot;You've done an excellent job taking care of me, little one.&quot;\n\n&quot;Thank you, Miss,&quot; he offers sincerely and blushes.\n\nYou move your free foot down to the fabric of his boxers and push on the opening, freeing his cock as it springs back in forth. You run your bare foot up the side of his cock and pull the other free and sway it in front of his face.\n\n&quot;Perhaps it's time you receive something for your service. Lick,&quot; you command and extend your foot to his face as the other presses his cock to his stomach.\n\nHe sucks with care until he covers your toes in salvia, all while your foot smashes his cock between his soft flesh and your feminine feet. You take great pleasure in watching the shock on his face when you lower your slippery toes from his mouth to his cock and begin to rub his erection between your toes. You feel his cock twitch every time a toes brushes his head and wonder if you should let him cum\n\n&quot;Uh-uhmm. Could I stand so it's easier for me to keep my balance?&quot; he timidly asks. \n\nYou don't see the harm and allow it. He positions himself so that your feet stroke his entire cock now and you have to bend your legs back. While stroking him you notice he is slowly scooting towards you and putting more pressure on you.\n\n[[Push him back|Carla6B1]]\n[[Ignore it|Carla6B2]]</div><div tiddler="Int22.1" tags="" created="201609052046" modifier="twee" twine-position="4350,6170">Neither options available to you appear to be good choices and you begin to wonder if this was your brightest idea.

You think to yourself how odd it is that someone would go through the effort and step outside to look for the woman who gave you the card but she had already vanished.\n\nYou decided to play the message once you got back to your apartment and wondered if this was just some elaborate marketing gimmick; a salesperson with an overblown and dramatic flair to how she presents herself.

Now a man in his fifties, he is looking very corporate. When you joined the marines you were considered one of the best and after a couple of years you passed Special Forces selection and ended up in recon. A number of years later, you were made part of a clandestine infiltration team where combat and intelligence specialists joined into a black ops teams.\n\nDuring your time in the Special Forces, Greg was a Senior Sergeant and did not like you, or women, in general at all; they had no place in //his// SF. Greg was really a chauvinistic macho male whose experience with women was purely using them as a hole to fuck While he was right that most women who joined the unit weren’t cut out, most like yourself excelled in a certain areas. Greg missed or ignored these points and he never spoke with you after you became an infiltrator.\n\nGreg cared most for his area of specialism, assault. He tended to load up with lots of weapons and deployed rapidly into hot zones. His world was built on careful planning, dedicated training, and then a short, precision bloodbath. When you joined, on the initial training course you struggled at this portion of training and placed in the bottom third of the group. This was offset when you scored top in recon and sniping.\n\nGreg was the lead instructor on the assault module and publicly stated that you probably sucked someone off to get a shot at all. These insults continued until your high marks in the recon module when he started saying he was going to fuck you and show you your place. This led to harassment until he tried his luck in the shower by grabbing your tit and starting to slip a finger into your pussy. This ended with him getting knocked out and fracturing his skull. All from &quot;slipping on the wet floor&quot; of course.\n\nThe event was witnessed and the subsequent enquiry resulted in him being stripped of a rank and you put on restricted privileges. The military logic was to put out a warning against to violence and instructors laying into students. The situation still ended with Greg getting in remarks that he said he was going to fuck you and the joke and banter never faded away. You said that you would never fuck him and anyway you kept away from men in your unit. You never risked physical relationships as fucking inside the unit could lead to jealousy and lowered morale.\n\n[[Greg spots you and starts to walk your way|Reds4.1]]</div><div tiddler="CBA1A.1" tags="" created="201602011740" modifier="twee" twine-position="1690,2110">You attempt to pull yourself in tighter to her back so you can hold still.\n\n&quot;Enjoying yourself back there, my little slut?&quot; she asks with a laugh.\n\nYou try to answer her, but are cut off as you lose your breath once more over a tortuous depression. The thinner air away from the Evindium atmosphere plants only makes it harder to collect yourself.\n \n&quot;Don't worry, it’s only a little ways farther ahead,&quot; she purrs, &quot;and then we can get to know each other a //little// bit better.&quot;\n \nMercifully, she pulls into a driveway and shuts down the source of your pleasure and anguish for what felt like an eternity. You try to stumble your way off of the bike but she is there to hold you up by your lapels. Before you can respond, she pulls you in close and begins kissing all around your neck. You let out a moan as she grabs your hand and forces it between her legs under her trousers. \n\n&quot;See how wet you've made me, my little slut?&quot; she whispers into your ear. Your breath runs shallow as you melt to her words and she forcefully kisses you, her tongue penetrating her lips as you let out a pitiful whimper.\n \nShe breaks from your mouth and half drags you towards the building. You turn around as you get closer to the door and see other bikers arriving and pulling into the driveway. As you get inside the door, the goth girl takes a few steps forward before pressing you against a wall and tearing off your clothes as she kisses you. \n\nShe steps back and begins to unlace her leather pants before shimmying them down as you slump against the wall. She then walks over to your crumpled body. You stare up and are greeted by the sight of her dripping slit before she straddles your face. You’re soon licking away and it does not take long for her to cum all over your mouth. When she does orgasm, you collapse onto your back, still dizzy from your own on the ride here.\n \nYou find yourself lying on the floor with your legs spread, completely exposed, when you notice the goth girl standing over you with a cheshire like grin on her face.\n \n&quot;I know you head those engine die down outside a second ago. If you don’t get up, then those men will walk in here, see you with your legs spread, and assume you’re in need of a good fucking. So,&quot; she asks staring you in the eyes, &quot;what is it going to be, my little slut?&quot;\n \nYou recall seeing six bikers as you were dragged in; four men and two women. You hear a pounding on the door and know that you need to make your decision immediately.\n \n[[Get up|CBA1C]] \n[[Lie there and bite your lip in anticipation|CBA1D]]</div><div tiddler="Reds6" tags="Relationship" created="201508231440" modifier="twee" twine-position="2810,1270">You give Claire a call since she told you that she’s usually in the Space Quarter during this time of the week. She answers and sounds genuinely happy that you decided to take her up on her offer. She says that she’ll be over in ten minutes and asks you to order the coffee so it is ready.\n\nYou have the freshly brewed cup waiting for her as she arrives and joins you at the table. Claire is wearing a business suit which causes you to raise an eyebrow at her attire.\n\nFiguring out why you give her such a look, Claire quickly explains, &quot;Oh, this is for my part time job.&quot; You don’t pry about the subject any further but she continues, &quot;I work as a human resources manager for a cleaning company here in the Space Quarter.&quot; \n\nYou put two and two together and realize that the mission requires you to infiltrate the target using a cleaning company worker’s ID. You wink at Claire with a knowing smile before saying, &quot;Well, you know, I //have// been thinking about a career in the cleaning industry lately.&quot;\n\nClaire smiles back at you. You spend the hour talking about general matters but you couldn’t shake the feeling you were being interviewed. She had to have been a cop at some point of her life with how she phrases her questions but you liked her and her passion for what she was doing. She seems like a true believer in her cause and clearly has guts. Business is business though and you soon left for the company to get you formally hired.\n\nOn the way she gave you fingerprint overlays made of synthetic skin and told you that any CCTV camera at the cleaning company office would mysteriously be malfunctioning or the video feed would be altered. Once you signed the paperwork making you a temporary hire you formally said your goodbyes and you exited the building.\n\n[[Return to your apartment|Apartment]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;NOTE: New Mission Received&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Claire to 1&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Mis6 to &quot;True&quot;&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $CRSB to 0&gt;&gt;\n</div><div tiddler="Int22.6" tags="" created="201609061247" modifier="twee" twine-position="4210,6310">You still yourself for what is to come and take your first step towards the Red Light District.

What if it is normal for your implants to communicate back to the service provider? The problem is you don’t know, all you got as a reference is that in the military you had a minor check every month, and then a full check-up as part of a 6-monthly medical. \n\nNow you have your implants as part of a deal with Sid, Sid implied that to get your ex-military implants reactivated he would have to use some black-market channels.  Mainly due to licensing you were told. The more paranoid part of you says there is something not right here, you felt so empty when your implants were deactivated, but when you left the military, you noticed they were gone, but it was no big deal. Well you noticed it when you did martial arts and fitness training.   The really paranoid part of you wonders if you are being controlled in some way, or is Sid spying on you? If so, Sid will know you are coming to this location?\n\nTime will tell, you think, but you decided to leave your armour and rifle behind, nor did you decide to use your stealth suit. \n\nIf Sid has anyone here, you feel reasonably prepared with your sword and pistols. \n\nThe place seems empty and you are soon close to your objective, a set of storage arrays.

They glance over at you, seemingly deciding you're unimportant, then focus their attention back on Carla.\n\n&quot;Look, Carla. We thought about it and figure you been tryin' it on with all this pretendin' you're too poor to pay us. We know you’ve had a steady stream of customers lately,&quot; comes the shrill voice of the member you assume is the boss of the three.\n\n&quot;Now, if you don’t pay us up right now, we might have'ta break yer legs,&quot; chips in another from behind.\n\n&quot;If my legs are broken, I can’t exactly work you idiots. You would’t get //any// money then, would you?&quot; chides a slightly defiant and frustrated Carla. &quot;You guys know I owe a lot of money to Lenny from getting this place up and running.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, we’ll give you the same choice we give everyone who can’t pay: you either earn us some extra cash spreadin' them legs of yours or sell us a controlling stake in the business,&quot; says the leader as he twists his gead and leers at her.\n\n&quot;Spreading my legs or selling a stake in my business is not an option and you know it! Look, please, there is not much I can do until Lenny is paid off. I’m doing well enough that the debt is finally slowly going down,&quot; she pleads with them.\n\n&quot;What I’m gonna do is focus on these crazy thoughts you seem to be havin' about not payin' us for right now. Your friend here is going to have an accident and it's gonna be all your fault, Carla. Mmmmmhm... All your fault when her pretty face is messed up, her legs are all broken, and then she’s left outside to get raped in a gutter til she fuckin' dies! What do you have to say about //that// now, Carla? Still can’t pay up!?&quot; sneers the group's leader.\n\nYou know where this is going and position yourself near a spiked knuckleduster that Carla keeps for show. One of the thugs makes a move for you and you react, kick out, and reach the knuckleduster. Carla is left speechless when all three thugs go down over a very short period of time. You didn't get totally off without a scratch as you managed to get slammed into a wall. They're much worse off now that one is dead with a caved in front skull and the other two are down and out.\n\nCarla looks shocked by what happened, as does her security person as he walks in and surveys the scene and starts to turn white.\n\n&quot;C-Carla... They will fucking kill us for sure when they learn what happened!&quot; he accusatorily screams in a panic. \n\n&quot;Get restraints and a vehicle. We need to dispose of the bodies,&quot; you order.\n\nHe looks at you like he is going to question you then nods in agreement. Carla wakes up to the seriousness of the situation and tells him that her car is below the building in an underground residential carpark. Her biggest concern about reaching there is that the carpark is monitored by a CCTV system. When the security person comes back, you get the two living thugs restrained and get the security person to get them to Carla’s car.\n\nYou get the details of the CCTV system from Carla and contact Jane. Your plan is to use the Magnum’s computer system to copy CCTV from different days to fool the street gang. You tell her that once the CCTV are altered and the bodies are dumped, no-one will know the thugs ended up there. Carla is shocked but asks what she can do to help.\n\n&quot;Get on your hands and knees and clean the blood and mess up,&quot; you quickly order. Carla finds some humour in the fact you are in her dungeon and telling her what to do, but asks about the other two, are they going to die?\n\n&quot;They will be killed at the disposal point, they are easier to move alive, and you don't want to clear more blood do you&quot; you reply in a clinical cold hearted fashion that spooks Carla even more.\n\nAfter you help dispose of the bodies in another part of Evindium you return to the dungeon and find that no-one has come looking for the thugs yet. Carla warns you that someone is bound to have seen the thugs heading this way and suspicion will still fall on her. You tell her that it will take some time, as the street gang will think someone is trying to muscle in on their turf before they'd investigate anyone like her. You will see what you can do to help in the meantime.\n\nThis leaves Carla with lots of questions and the poor girl looks dumbfounded when you leave. You could swear there is still the same calculating look in her eye as you walk out and you have to admit you’ve always liked her devious streak.\n\n[[Return to your apartment|Apartment][$Days = $Days + 0.5]] &lt;&lt;set $CarlaChat to 2&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="SC76" tags="" created="201608211558" modifier="twee" twine-position="7990,2250">//Even though Celeste told herself she was doing what she must to survive, she couldn’t ignore a nagging feeling that told her she really didn’t have to kill that man.//\n\nYour ''Training'' has increased by 1%.</div><div tiddler="RTG4B3.1" tags="" created="201609020237" modifier="twee" twine-position="1550,5470">Mark makes the first move, firing off a flurry of blows at your chest while you attempt to maintain your guard.

He clenches briefly at his side and winces and you think you may have gotten lucky and broken one or more of his ribs. Taking advantage of the situation, you make a break for the button to end the round.\n\n&quot;You dumb cunt. Don’t you fucking dare!&quot; Mark bellows as he runs full force towards you.\n\nThe roof is now slick with the rain and Mark is unable to adjust when you side step his rush and trip him.

Look, please, there is not much I can do until Lenny is paid off. I’m doing well enough that the debt is finally slowly going down,&quot; she pleads with them.\n\n&quot;What I’m gonna do is focus on these crazy thoughts you seem to be havin' about not payin' us for right now. Your friend here is going to have an accident and it's gonna be all your fault, Carla. Mmmmmhm...

You didn't get totally off without a scratch as you managed to get slammed into a wall. They're much worse off now that one is dead with a caved in front skull and the other two are down and out.\n\nCarla looks shocked by what happened, as does her security person as he walks in and surveys the scene and starts to turn white.\n\n&quot;C-Carla... They will fucking kill us for sure when they learn what happened!&quot; he accusatorily screams in a panic. \n\n&quot;Get restraints and a vehicle. We need to dispose of the bodies,&quot; you order.\n\nHe looks at you like he is going to question you then nods in agreement. Carla wakes up to the seriousness of the situation and tells him that her car is below the building in an underground residential carpark. Her biggest concern about reaching there is that the carpark is monitored by a CCTV system. When the security person comes back, you get the two living thugs restrained and get the security person to get them to Carla’s car.\n\nYou get the details of the CCTV system from Carla and contact Jane. Your plan is to use the Magnum’s computer system to copy CCTV from different days to fool the street gang. You tell her that once the CCTV are altered and the bodies are dumped, no-one will know the thugs ended up there. Carla is shocked but asks what she can do to help.\n\n&quot;Get on your hands and knees and clean the blood and mess up,&quot; you quickly order. Carla finds some humour in the fact you are in her dungeon and telling her what to do, but asks about the other two, are they going to die?\n\n&quot;They will be killed at the disposal point, they are easier to move alive, and you don't want to clear more blood do you&quot; you reply in a clinical cold hearted fashion that spooks Carla even more.\n\nAfter you help dispose of the bodies in another part of Evindium you return to the dungeon and find that no-one has come looking for the thugs yet. Carla warns you that someone is bound to have seen the thugs heading this way and suspicion will still fall on her. You tell her that it will take some time, as the street gang will think someone is trying to muscle in on their turf before they'd investigate anyone like her. You will see what you can do to help in the meantime.\n\nThis leaves Carla with lots of questions and the poor girl looks dumbfounded when you leave. You could swear there is still the same calculating look in her eye as you walk out and you have to admit you’ve always liked her devious streak.\n\n[[Return to your apartment|Apartment][$Days = $Days + 0.5]] &lt;&lt;set $CarlaChat to 2&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Objective Complete" tags="" created="201510251534" modifier="twee" twine-position="5470,150">You have advanced one of your key Mission Objectives!

This could mean you killing her as even a short time working with you could let her know about life or death matters. \n\nThe thought is sobering, if it all works out you could gain a useful associate, even replacing the Hugo situation where you have a trusted gunslinger.

One of his regrets was to dissuade Sarah from joining the military, and look what happens, someone selling a dream does this to her. Geoff tells you that Sarah has always been a tough one, but now there is an anger in her and he is worried she may try and kill someone, or get involved in some petty street gang. Life with you and serious, professional mercenaries is probably a better thing for her. Geoff begs you that if she does go with you, you will look after her and see she does alright. You say you have not made your mind up but if you do, then yes, you would look after her, but your life is dangerous. \n\nYour thoughts are still divided on the options, but either way you have decided to deal with Mr Maloney.

Is she trying to seduce you?\n\nYou tell Sarah that you have found out where Steve Maloney lives and that you plan to visit him, and enquire whether she would want to join you for the unsocial visit. Sarah’s eyes almost pop out of her head, a smile breaks out and she starts to shake before collecting herself, calming down and saying yes.

What you work out is they mainly smuggle high value metals out, which would otherwise have a high tax, or has been stolen from the corporations. On the inbound smuggling, they bring in a few weapons, and other high tech contraband but nothing too serious.\n\nThe reason is that the corporations appreciate that they will lose equipment, or people will sell stuff to the less desirables and equipment will be smuggled in. What they don’t want is kit becoming common to the point that the street gangs are having regular firefights. When that happens, they need to heavily raid before the situation gets any worse, basically an armed population needs a high-tech security force, which is expensive. So the smugglers have teamed up with the Aruba Syndicate as they have good corporation connections and help set limits on what is imported. Not because they have any moral concerns, but it is toeing the line. What happened before with the mech tells them that the corporation ran government is quite happy to eliminate criminal organisations from time to time.  No court of justice system to slow them down, just effort and the knowledge that a new criminal organisation will always form to fill a gap.

All they can assess is basic cybernetic implants and your neural implants are too small to be picked up. \n\nThe next part of the registration process is an assessment of your fighting skills. This again also really basic and part of it is recorded to show to the audience beforehand. Some fighters and teams will over or underplay how good their fighting is.

You wonder what the hell that is for, some kind of bondage device?\n\nYou are then blindfolded and led off a short way, you then enter some kind of cubicle and are turned around and told not to move. While in there you feel something attached to the metal rod in your nose, and then you are asked to poke your tongue out where a piercing is inserted into your tongue.  After that you are told to squat down and be prepared for some insertions, as you squat down you feel the lube covered dildos and start to nudge them in. Once they are in your arms and ankles are positioned and cuffed into uncomfortable positions.  Followed by a neck restraint being applied and them asking for you to poke your tongue out which via the piercing is attached to the neck restraint.  As the apparently final step is to attach your nose to something unseen, which pulls your head up and your mouth fully open. Unable to speak and, or close your mouth, limbs restrained and pussy and ass filled you get the idea of this device.  You can guess that your mouth is going to be filled next……\n\n[[Time for the blindfold to be removed|Shebo6B]]\n</div><div tiddler="SH2.1" tags="" created="201509202139" modifier="twee" twine-position="1270,2950">You decide to take up the bartender’s offer of a drink and the he gestures you over to a corner of the bar where there is a sofa, table, and chairs filled by a number of smugglers.

You speak quietly with her and tell her that castrating the man, while satisfying will leave blood all over the place. Someone may pay for a professional investigation and as Sarah is a native of the planet it may lead back to her, or her father. You tell her that the easiest way is to order the girl to flip Maloney over the balcony and then confess to the murder. Then it would be prudent to remove the girl from the equation as well. Sarah deflates at that saying the girl is innocent, you agree the girl is innocent, now a mindless sex slave, it is like killing a pet. Not nice.  Sarah understands and tells you that she did not think it would be this hard, but Maloney must die.\n\nYou join Sarah and apply ankle restraints to Maloney and call the girl over and tell her to follow. You then take Maloney to his 50th floor balcony and look down. You don’t want to drop Maloney onto some poor pedestrian, luckily for you the drop is onto a concrete roof of the car park. Pushing Maloney to the edge you tell the girl to grab his ankles and lift him up. Like a cantilever Maloney’s chest rests on the balcony and has his legs go up his head dips under the balcony edge.  The last you see is Maloney’s pleading eyes and muffled words due to the gag before gravity takes over and his head and chest starting heading downwards. The girl is dragged towards the edge of the balcony and tries to hold onto his ankles but is not strong enough and Maloney plummets to his death.\n\nThe girl in a does not compute mode chuckles, then looks worried “Mistress not happy?”\n\n“Mistress very happy” you reply. You then tell the girl that she needs to tell the concierge that she failed her old master by dropping over the edge of the balcony and then come back. You lead the naked girl down to the reception and watch out of sight. To be fair you could be in plain sight and the concierge would be unlikely to spot you, his eyes are glued to the naked woman walking in a seductive, swaying manner towards him. When she tells him what happened he looks absolutely shocked and starts muttering to himself that it is a windup. You watch a CCTV image appear and he quickly cycles through and spots the red splat and various body parts of Maloney. You watch the girl who is already getting into the elevator as the concierge looks up “Wait” he shouts but the lift doors are closing. You rush up the stairwell and get a lift up from the floor below.\n\nWhen you get back to the apartment Sarah has been busy wiping finger prints off surfaces just in case a basic investigation is started. The girl is stood waiting for instructions and you reluctantly tell her to jump off the balcony herself. The girl actually thanks you and smiles, before walking off, you wonder to yourself how much mind is left after the mind wipe process. Is there some part of the girl locked in her mind as a spectator? You know that to dwell on such thoughts is not good in this harsh world.\n\nAs you both make your way out of the building via a fire exit you notice that the concierge has called in a cleaning bot to sort out the mess. If luck goes your way then a cleaning bot will be used on the apartment so a new customer can be brought in as quickly as possible.  After all the apartment block needs paying customers and talk of murder puts people off from moving in.  The irony is that ‘suicide’ is quite common and cleaning bots have programmes for delicately collecting human remains for funerals.\n\nThe decision now is whether you recruit Sarah Tranter. You reckon for the short term she will have to live with you at your apartment, but you could introduce her to Jane, who would have someone to talk to. The key thing is what company Sarah would be, you don’t want to saddle Jane with a manic depressive, if she is. The fact is you don’t know and you only will by spending time with Sarah.\n\n[[Recruit Sarah|Apartment][$SarahTranter to 1]]\n\n[[Tell her you will think about it|Apartment]]\n\n&lt;&lt;set $Days to $Days + 0.5&gt;&gt;\n</div><div tiddler="SC37" tags="" created="201512230848" modifier="twee" twine-position="8130,1270">//Celeste restained herself for a total stranger and then got so aroused that she could not keep her hands to herself when released.

Soon the minute is up and you are off to hop again. This time you begin feeling the effects more prominently as the crotch rope rubs and digs into places where you want only fine cotton or silk. You get around again and start back to work on Lina but get a feeling that the minute is just too short which isn’t helped by a lack of hands either. Soon you are off again but after multiple laps you are starting to feel the fatigue even in your athletically enhanced body.\n\nIt ends as you get slower and slower on the trip round and Lina starts laughing and shouting for you to go faster. When you don't complete the two laps in a minute Lina asks that now you have failed will you beg for release. You know you have no choice at this point; your legs are finished. Your stubborn tendencies caused you to carry on with the jump squats until your legs basically seized up.\n\n&quot;Please, Lina. I have been punished... I beg you, please release me!&quot; you say at your wits end.\n\n&quot;Ok, come and finish me off. You can crawl on your knees&quot; Lina commands. You obey, crawling over so your head is pushed into her groin. As before Lina pushes you back until the crotch rope causes you to gasp. This time with no distractions or time limit you bring Lina to orgasm.\n\n&quot;You played with me at the Dojo, Celeste. You were thinking of sex and showing off your skill, but instead you have been humbled. I think there is a lesson there, don't you think?&quot; Lina sternly warns you.

You are not sure that it is a good idea as you are feeling a bit tender down there but Lina insists.\n\nAfter the crotch rope is removed, you find yourself still restrained but with Lina between your thighs using both her fingers and tongue. This proves to be a mix of both pain and pleasure as you have gained a number of rope burns down there. The pleasure outweighs pain and you cum hard to Lina's fingers and tongue. Fatigued by your impromptu fitness session, you listen politely as Lina tells you she will treat you like a queen if you visit her father. The last bit is emphasized with her tongue. \n\nLina releases you and you get dressed. You leave on shaky legs saying you will arrange a time to meet her father. Lina is right, you will remember this day for a long time to come. Why did you let the thought of sex dominate your mind in the contest?

The operation is a raid against suspected smugglers located in Terminal F. This gang is known to be armed and mercs have been brought into support a security mech. You get the feeling that this briefing is pointless and can tell they have no intent of arresting anyone tonight. This will likely end in a blood bath and the mercs can be used as scapegoats if there are any issues. Billy probably knows this and if he doesn’t then he is more foolish than you were led to believe.\n\nAfter the main briefing concludes, Billy gives his own addendum to add a few points. Your role in this is to gain access through some service ducts and set up an observation post. You are then to execute anyone ‘resisting arrest’ who comes you way. It isn’t likely you’ll see many people once the mech opens up with its chain gun, but they want to be certain there are no survivors or witnesses.

When she gives you permission to enter and asks what you are there for, you tell her you are turning up for your session. Carla seems pleased by the fact you chose to strip down and you two get to chatting, briefly interupted as the receptionist excuses herself to go get lunch. \n\nCarla asks you to kneel in front of holds out her right foot towards your face and stretches her toes as a form of encouragement.\n\n&quot;Clean them,&quot; she dryly states.\n\nWithout any hesitation, you lean forward and start sucking on her big toe. You suckle and slurp until you're sure it is clean, then lap between her toes, before moving left to the next. You become engrossed in what you are doing and don't even notice when your Mistress extends her left foot behind your head. She rubs her toes into your hair and pushes your head forward.\n\n&quot;You're going too slow, slave,&quot; she chastises. &quot;Suck the rest of them clean at the same time. With that you take the rest of her toes in your mouth, her big toe rubbing on your cheek. Carla gives you new instructions, to get dressed and head out to the alley behind the dungeon to wait for Carla's receptionist to return. Carla tells you that her receptionist is probably getting fucked now, maybe even a liquid lunch she tells you with a chuckle.  \n\nThis is your big test she tells you, she wants you to serve the receptionist, like the little sub slut you are.  You feel that you are crossing a boundary, now not just submissive to your mistress, in her dungeon, but being submissive to another, and out in public. Albeit in a quiet area, there is not much you can say with her toes in your mouth, when she releases you, you agree to the task with both a feeling of trepidation and excitement from the look on Carla's face.  \n\nCarla keeps you kneeling at her feet for a few more minutes, then releases you to get re-dressed and head out into the alley. You start to feel uneasy and contemplate just skipping out but sure enough, barely past 30 minutes from when you first arrived, the receptionist comes sauntering into the alleyway. Her hair is disheveled and she has a glow about her. She is now wearing a red, satin crop top, a black leather skirt, and some black strappy peep-toe heels. You're certain she got laid just like Carla implied.\n\n&quot;Well, well, Celeste. I honestly wasn't sure you'd show up,&quot; she says with a chuckle. &quot;Such a good girl. I hope you're hungry. My date was feeling especially horny today and came inside of me three times. Maybe I just subconsciously milked him dry because I figured you'd be here but I'm surprised I've managed to keep all of it in. Now get over here so we can get started.&quot;\n\nThe receptionist steps behind a dumpster and leans her body against the wall while spreading her legs and hiking up her skirt. This leaves only her head still exposed to any passerby. She motions for you to kneel in front of her and you comply, positioning your face just inches from her crotch. \n\n&quot;I know it's pretty, dear, but I'm not here just to have you stare at it.&quot; She says as grabs you by your hair and pushes your face into her crotch. \n\n[[Time for your dessert|RecepDate2]]&lt;&lt;set $SubTrg +=1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $CPTimer to $Days + 3&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Carla5A" tags="" created="201805262248" modifier="twee" twine-position="3370,570">When you arrive you are quickly directed to Carla's office for a //chat// on how things are proceeding, you kind of expect a discussion on your feelings, but Carla cuts straight to the point;\n\n&quot;You want to further explore your proper place at my feet, eh, my dear?&quot; Carla asks while grinning as you feel her boot brush your ankle from underneath the desk. &quot;Let's head to the red room again for this.&quot;\n\nOn your way to the room, Carla breaks off for a moment to ask her receptionist to grab something. The two of you enter the room and Carla settles in the same armchair as she had in your previous session.

Today I want you to go to the small cabinet on the wall and pick a polish out of it. I'm not sure if you've painted your nails yourself before, so make sure to grab a clear top coat and base coat too.&quot;\n\nYou feel slightly embarrassed at how over eager you had been to strip but you believe that was the entire point. It didn't help your nerves that she wasn't incorrect about not painting your nails on your own before; it had always been easier to have them done before nights out on New Terra.

She runs a constant dialogue with Shaun as you caress her breasts, nipples, inner thighs and other erogenous zones. \n\nSlowly and sensually you move down to her inner thighs and tease her pussy mound, then her inner lips, before slipping a finger into her damp hole. Carla starts giving you directions on various fingering techniques before telling you to go down on her. As you start licking her out, she keeps up the dialogue and Shaun watches rapt with attention while stroking his erect member.\n\nCarla starts to purr with excitement and desire as her words becomes broken up with comments such as, &quot;R-right th-there.&quot; as she pants and moans more. Suddenly she shouts, &quot;Shaun, you can fuck Celeste in her slutty pussy&quot;. With Carla's juices running over your chin and your tongue flicking her clit, you simply carry on with more enthusiasm; after all, your pussy //is// aching for some attention.\n\nShaun happily complies and he roughly thrusts two of his fingers into your pussy. They slide right in, so with a bit of fumbling he lines up his knob and rams it inside of you. He carries on like a bucking bronco, banging you doggy style, mashing your face into Carla's pussy. His enforced pussy bashing of brings her to a climax and Shaun soon ejaculates inside of you, leaving you the only one without an orgasm.\n\nAs Carla starts to come down from her orgasm she smiles and says, &quot;Now you see what the problem is, he doesn't last long. Celeste, I want you to lie on the bed and let Shaun fuck you missionary style. I'm going to hold his hips and make him pace himself.&quot; Again you comply, hoping that this time your aching pussy will get the attention it wants. \n\nIt soon becomes apparent to you that Carla is playing a game. She is slowing Shaun down and making sure that he rubs the right spots, but as you start to come close to orgasm, she stops him from finishing you off. As a final point, when Shaun does orgasm a second time, she pulls Shaun out so his semen covers your belly and pubic hair.\n\n&quot;Shaun, try licking out Celeste while I go and get something,&quot; she orders with a devious grin.\n\nShaun complies and starts eagerly eating you out. You reach down and pull his head in, hoping to get the orgasm you have been denied. A few moments pass and Shaun is pulled off you by Carla who is now wearing a big strap-on. \n\n&quot;Celeste, roll over and onto your knees like a good girl,&quot; she commands. You follow the instructions and roll over onto your belly and get on all fours.\n\nCarla wastes no time and slips the strap-on dildo into your wet pussy and starts to roughly bang you. Rough sex has turned you on for some time now and as your pleasure builds you start to groan loudly.\n\n&quot;Shaun, Celeste wants your dick in her mouth,&quot; Carla says with a laugh. \n\nWithout hesitation, he climbs onto the bed with his cock bouncing towards your mouth. You accept his member and wrap your lips around it as Carla continues to bang you, sometimes choking you on Shaun’s member. It doesn't take long and you feel your pussy clench the dildo as you have an intense, body-shaking orgasm.\n\nCarla lets out a little triumphant, &quot;Yes,&quot; and pulls out of you. &quot;Shaun, come and taste Celeste juices,&quot; she says as she offer the dildo for him to suck. Shaun, to his credit, does not do it, but you have no doubt that before long Carla will have trained him. Carla, irritated, pulls your head off Shaun’s cock which you were starting to focus more attention. &quot;No more of that, Shaun,&quot; Carla snorts. Shaun pulls away and says nothing in response. After things cool down, Shaun goes to get a shower and at Carla's suggestion you two chat.\n\n&quot;Celeste, I know you are a strong girl, but I can tell you enjoy being submissive sometimes too,&quot; she starts and you nod in agreement. &quot;I can make it up to you. Feel free to find me at the Red Light District.

A lot of people, especially people who are new to the scene, will push their limits so don't hesitate to check on them yourself. Every sub should have a safe word and if they use it, you are to stop everything immediately. After sessions, sometimes subs can still be emotionally and or physically exhausted, so we have snacks and water up by the receptionist.\n\n&quot;Once they have left, you are responsible for sanitizing any equipment you have utilized during the sessions.

You find yourself walking on tip-toe, stiff-legged, as you approach the pillars in the centre of the room.\n\nThe thought of what you're about to do terrifies you but at the same time is driving you mad with arousal.

Each ominous &quot;clunk&quot; as they latch closed around your limbs makes you hornier. Straightening, you put the wrist cuffs on, and their solidity gets you so hot and bothered that you try to reach down to rub one out, only to find that the cables won't let you reach that far, which only arouses you further. Sweating with desire in the cool air, you press the blindfold into place, wrap the ribbons around your head and tie them. Your knees twitch as if your body is trying to kneel down in front of a man who hasn't arrived yet, but you have a far more submissive and vulnerable pose in mind and it requires one more accessory. The ear-plugs fit into your ears and you adjust the hair-band to fit snugly feel to make sure that the car ears are facing forwards. Deaf, dumb, and blind, you feel out at your sides for the handles.\n\nWith your fingers wrapped around them, you hesitate. What if it's a trap? What if he doesn't come and you're stuck here for days? What if someone else looking for him gets here first? What if this was a test and you're about to fail it? What if he decides to use you like a warm, meek, whimpering sex toy and share videos of your humiliation with his friends, and they share it with their friends and the whole world gets to see you like this? Your head goes light as you imagine yourself naked, helpless, and unable to protest before being used and used by a man you've never seen. You'd end up taking whatever he dishes out and writhing with pleasure against the tension of the cables holding you prisoner.\n\nYou suddenly find you've already subconsciously pulled the handles as you thought that. Your arms are stretched wide and high, your legs pulled straight and wide, your crotch open to the world, and all of you on show, just waiting for the lucky winner to walk through the door and claim you as his own.

They go over the whole thing three or four times in total before they're satisfied that you have learned everything.\n\nYour contact adds one last thing. &quot;You may return here later for de-briefing.&quot;\n\nWith that he clicks something and a loud buzz fills the room. A moment later it’s you that is buzzing as a vibrator is pressed hard into your crotch. You have no idea how many times you come, hanging helplessly with bright red lines burning across your ass. Eventually he steps back, shuts off the evil, wonderful toy, sets it down, and starts to release you. Your legs won't come together under you or straighten and when he releases your arms you slump against him, weakly hugging his neck as he takes your weight.\n\nHe lowers you to the floor and you start to feel for the knot in the ribbons holding the blindfold in place but he smacks your hands away. Surprised, you sit and wait. He drops your clothes in your lap then stands over you and watches you put them on by touch. Only when you're fully dressed, still soaked in your own juices underneath your clothes, and he’s helped walk you to the door does he undo the blindfold and gag and take them back. \n\nThe door opens and he gently pushes you out into the daylight. As you try to keep your balance, the door closes and locks behind you. You have your mission now... and some new memories for when you’re alone.\n\n[[Return to your apartment|Apartment][$Days = $Days + 1]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC39&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;NOTE: New Mission Received&lt;/p&gt; &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Mental = $Mental + 4&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Training = $Training + 3&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $KSA to &quot;True&quot;&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $KS to 3&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Int9 to &quot;Complete&quot;&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Mis10 to &quot;True&quot;&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Intel9H2" tags="" created="201505130615" modifier="twee" twine-position="4490,4070">The wait seems interminable. Thoughts of what could happen, what could be done to you, keep you short of breath and full of tingles as you partly stand and hang in the middle of his room, limbs splayed and head bowed.\n\nSuddenly, something is touching your face and it's not a drop of sweat. You freeze, your breath stopped, as it gently moves from cheekbone to jawline. The touch is repeated on the other side and you have to force yourself to start breathing again. It's hard enough to keep up breathing while you've got the ball-gag in and you can't really afford to stop like that. The same light touch, too smooth for skin, traces one of your arms from elbow to shoulder and then down your other side from chest to hip. You wait, offering neither encouragement nor complaint, as it is repeated on your thighs, on your back, on your face, around your neck, on your arms, and then on your breasts. You're starting to think you have some idea what it is, then it slithers over a nipple and your mind explodes.\n\nAs you get back in touch with your body, you find that the soft touch has been replaced with an ordinary human hand gently cupping the side of your face and you've tilted your head to press gently back against it. It moves, and fingertips stroke through your hair, above and then down behind your ear. The fingernails are trimmed short and kept neat as they barely register as the hand makes a light scratching motion behind your earlobe. You think you may be purring at the feeling and then it's gone. You hear yourself whimper and cut the sound off, leaving silence. There could be anything happening around you right now. All you can hear is what's transmitted up through your jawbones and right now that's just your heartbeat. If only someone would make you scream then you'd at least have something to hear.\n\nNothing happens for second after second and you wonder whether you imagined those touches. Then a hand curves around your right breast, the thumb stroking your nipple, and you know you're not imagining that. Your head comes up and tilts back, your breath whistling through your nose, as the mixture of light caresses and firm rubs builds the sparks inside you up to a raging fire. \n\nThe hand disappears again and you almost do scream. Then there's a mouth on your left breast, teeth grazing the nipple above and below, a tongue flickering over it and the fire inside you roars and grows furnace-hot. Somewhere near your body there are hands and you crave them. Every part of you they could possibly touch cries out for them to hold, stroke, or press against it, and you can do nothing but wait and want.\n\nFingertips brush your backside, from thighs to waist, and your hips kick forwards then back against the tension in your body. The mouth leaves your breast, the saliva cooling its sensitive peak, and hands return to them, one to each. You feel like you'll burn to death from the inside out if this teasing continues but you don't want it to ever stop. It does. \n\nAs the hands set off downwards, you don't even try not to whimper with frustration. Two palms stop on your hips, eight fingertips tracing swirls on your buttocks, and two thumbs press against you right over you ovaries. Your whole lower body tries to move forwards inside you and your frustrated whimper becomes a groan of desire. Then all contact is lost and you want to scream.\n\nThere's a horrible pause and the thought that you may have had all you're getting crosses your mind and it frightens you. You don't want to think about being let down now without someone satisfying you first... or do you mean satisfying himself? You wait. Something has to happen. You need something to happen. Something does: a hand comes down hard on your backside. \n\nYou can't hear the smack of the impact but you can certainly feel it. Your whole body jolts at the unexpected pain, then again as the other hand immediately appears at your crotch, the middle fingertip rubbing your clit. You feel nothing but joy at the thought of finally getting to get off... and it stops. There is another pause, then another smack, immediately followed by another rub of your clit. You get so close, so very close, but it stops again. Another smack, another burst of pleasure, then another and another, keeping you approaching the edge and being let down before he stops this rhythm.\n\nHe starts another, very similar, game. He teases you with gentle touches, stroking your face, your neck, your shoulders and the sides of your breasts, then squeezes a nipple hard and rubs your clit as he does so. Again he keeps you on the edge of orgasm the whole time he's hurting you, only letting you cool down when he's gentle. This sweet torture continues, then he stops and just holds a fingertip against your clit. You'd rub yourself against it but it's already as far forwards as you can press your hips. You could pull away from it, but you don't want to. You want the touch to go on. You want the pain to go on so the rubbing will go on. \n\nThe touch stays but the pain and the rubbing have both stopped. There's another wait, then the pain comes back in an intense flash across the full width of your behind. You have no idea what he used but he swung something at you hard despite the awkward angle. You have no time to be amazed as he starts rubbing your clit again. The slamming impact and burning pain come again and again, and so do you. You’re washed away in wave after wave of pleasure as the dam inside you gives way and all the fire floods out of your body and you follow it, falling down into a deep abyss.\n\nYou're awoken by someone biting your nipples. Your head snaps upright and the sensation is gone, leaving only an aching after-image. Again the gentle touches start, exploring your body and quickly building your arousal back up. For a few seconds, you're sure there's something you should have noticed just now, but it fades away. You have a single lucid moment when you notice you can't remember why you came here, then you're lost in the reason you are: the overwhelming joy of being teased and exploited brings you towards another explosive climax. Somewhere in the growing inferno, you again think there's something you should be noticing, but it doesn't seem to matter.\n\nHands knead your backside, a finger probes deep inside you to press your clit against the matching thumb, and tongues and teeth play with your breasts. Your second orgasm comes like lightning and you feel your body squeeze down hard on the finger inside it. At once, your left breast gets a stinging slap, punishment for coming without being hurt. You understand the rule at once: you have to fight off the orgasms until you are hurt, then you may come. You try. You try really hard but still come a third time, then a fourth, each time receiving a full-force slap to a breast the moment your vagina clamps tight on the finger inside it. Finally the pain starts again and you are filled with joy, knowing that you're allowed to let go and enjoy yourself. This time it's not your sore backside but your breasts that take the lashing, filling them with mind-shattering pain and you with floods of pleasure. When you come for the fifth time, it's like a firework finale to end all concerts and the world goes black.\n\n[[Wake up|Intel9H3]]</div><div tiddler="PPC2A" tags="" created="201507041740" modifier="twee" twine-position="1830,1830">You decide to grab a drink first and take in the club’s aesthetic before asking about work; you aren’t some young girl looking for their first job after all. You sit and reminisce again about how these were the sort of places you came to as a young marine; not so much as in infiltrator and officer, but definitely when you were fresh. You have known you were bisexual since your first lesbian experience at eighteen so going out with a group of male soldiers who were like family and ogling strippers was great fun. \n\nPretending to be purely a lesbian made life easier in the marines. The blokes wouldn’t fight over you or the other girls that said they didn’t like men, so it was common for even straight women to pretended to be lesbians. The more experienced marines generally could work it out but few made a big deal out of it. Back in those days you treated the strippers and other girls you met like bits of cute meat - to eat, molest, and enjoy; now you are considering becoming one of them! If you had said in your marine days that you wanted to work in a club like this, they would have never taken you seriously.\n\nYou know the chance of a stripper or bar staff finding out about a deal are slim. The girls here are for visual enjoyment, groping, serving drinks, and pleasuring people in the backrooms. While not a brothel, you have no doubt that for enough money you could get more than a lap dance. Places like this have screened privacy rooms where you could try and bug some meetings but it may be for nothing. What is clear is that you are missing the old days and you like the idea of working here. It could at least help you relax and maybe one of the more experienced girls would know something. But ou were a marine, and no serious marine would ever consider a job here, unless it was a bouncer! Here you are considering maybe being a stripper, or a waitress in the pussy cat outfits, so hot.\n\n[[Find leads elsewhere for now|Apartment]]\n[[Go ask about getting a job|PPC2B]] </div><div tiddler="PPC2B" tags="" created="201606261951" modifier="twee" twine-position="1970,1830">You head over and ask the bartender if they have any jobs. He calls for the manager who ushers you into a back office.  You are asked what experience you have and you’re honest about your lack of experience but tell him you can be very outgoing. You are an offworlder who recently arrived and are looking to supplement your income.\n\nYou can tell he does not really believe your story but he outlines the pay rates and asks if you would be willing to start today; he reckons he has an outfit that fits you. You’re assigned to work as a waitress, though you won’t need to take orders as that is done remotely. Your job is to present people with that extra personable touch when bringing them their drinks.\n\nYou agree and are shown back to the changing areas where you are confronted with a number of half-naked women; most of them strippers and other exotic dancers. The manager hands you over to a girl who he tells to get you a waitress outfit. The outfit is about what you’d expect: a leotard, cat ears, boots, and thigh high stockings. The leotard has sizeable openings that display a healthy amount of underboob as well as ass. The uniform is just enough clothing to leave a tiny bit to the imagination and you know you will look hot. \n\nThe girl introduces herself as the backstage manager and tells you to let her know if you want to do any extras: podium dancing, stripping, lap dances, or &quot;more&quot; accompanied with a knowing, friendly wink. She informs you that a lot of the waitresses are strippers and they just alternate turns on the ‘cat walk’ and doing general waitressing.  You ask about what she means by something more and she hesitates for a moment.\n\nYou are told that while this place is not a brothel some girls get more intimate with the clients. You digest this as the girl pulls out a scanner and takes your measurements and watch with amusement as the scanner gives its results. The girl smiles and tells you that you have got an ideal body type that the club’s customers love based on recent polling. You smile at this as the girl goes to get the appropriate sized clothes for you and shows you to the changing rooms.\n\nWith your gear stashed in a locker, you walk out in your high heels and tight outfit. You spend the next couple of hours being shown the ropes so that you’ll be ready for a shift on your own next time. You enjoy the looks you get from the customers as you strut around the place until your shift is over.\n\n&lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;''Staff are not allowed to have personal gatherings or socialize while off duty at the Pink Pussy Cat Club.

What you have heard is that these shows take poor, desperate people and offer them a chance of wealth and a better life. The downside is the odds are very slim and most end up dying in a gruesome manner.\n\nYou have never taken an interest in participating since the money was well below your mercenary pay and the chances of dying were a lot higher! Here on Evindium you don’t have that luxury anymore. At least you have a better chance of winning than most... so long as you can survive.\n\nAfter a few days Jane comes back to you with some bad news. Some Special Forces operatives have tried to win previously but it seems that who wins is mostly fixed. If you demonstrate higher skill, then the show will usually become harder. It is also rumoured that deals are sometimes struck and only popular contestants have a chance to get through. The only exception to this seems to be people who later end up become the antagonists of the show – the hunters. \n\nThe show at its most basic is about trying to get from Point-A to Point-B while these hunters are actively searching for you. If they manage to catch up to you then your only options are to either run, fight, or accept your demise. Routes are constricted to provide natural choke points where the hunters will often set up ambushes. It reminds you of crossing a river filled with crocodiles: if you rush en masse then some will get through but a lot will get lost in the process. The show is well aware of this mind-set which guarantees lots of desperate people hoping that they will make it big; it’s great for viewers and sponsors alike. \n\nThe hunters tend to be a mixture of close combat specialists, freaks, and snipers, all with their own unique psychotic traits. There is a five-thousand credit reward for anyone who completes all four stages of the show. This payout would set anyone up for a life of careful luxury, coming in at a bit over a million in Evindium’s local currency. You really wish this wasn’t one of the fastest ways to get the funds you need to flee the planet with Jane but it is.\n\n[[You need to plan this carefully|Intel3.1]]</div><div tiddler="Shebo6F" tags="" created="201711182119" modifier="twee" twine-position="6450,1690">When you arrive at the several storey penthouse suites you quickly come to the conclusion that you have no hope of doing anything, but being the high-class escort they think you are. The CEO’s Chief Bodyguard tells you that you are not cleared to spend time in his bed unescorted, and if he fucks you, you will be restrained. Not that would be a problem to a bondage whore like you he adds. \n\nThe security is really professional and the men and women are elite level guards, so stronger, probably faster, better in hand to hand combat, shooting and certainly better equipped and more numerous!   The only positive aspect is you are not going to be chained in some corner like a decoration but are expected to hostess to the //lower tables// as the CEO is being served by his Exec Assistants. \n\nYou soon get the feeling that things are very tense with the Xena Exec board, and it is all about stolen data, and what will happen once the contents of that data is analysed.  You also have the feeling that things are so serious you are only here as a spunk bucket for the CEO should he feel the need to unload.  Knowing what these corporate security types are like, you will be killed once the night is up and dumped in the dessert.  You can’t get a signal out with your comms chip and doubt you could be rescued anyway, a company of armoured special forces soldiers would be needed in this situation. \n\nSome of the in-country Xena Exec’s feel the tension as well, some you can tell don’t know why. So clearly there is an operation within an operation on planet, something has gone wrong and some don’t know why it is so bad that the CEO is here personally.  What you do see is that the CEO has a crypto chip close by to him, like a bank vault key these things control an important computer system. The military used to use them for fire control of fusion nuclear torpedo’s, a throwback to when governments were worried about an alien threat. The military used them in pairs, though anyone could use it, so not locked down to the Captain or Admiral, though they were in the possession of those officers.  The whole thing does not make sense, not that you think you will live long enough to find out why.\n\nYou do amuse yourself slightly though, that is with the Exec’s who created the //spunk cubicle// for you. It is clear that they did not know how serious the situation was, probably thinking the worst that could happen is a fall in share price and possibly their jobs going.  They probably knew what research was going on here, and how vital that was, but perhaps they did not know about other operations.  What you also notice is there are a few people here that you associate with Lantis Mining.  Now according to public knowledge Lantis hated Xena due to concern that Xena research on planet could impact mining operations, for example a release of something nasty.  Xena came to these planets due to if something went wrong, there was not a huge population, while Lantis came to strip mine the planet and did not want the planet evacuated because they would lose millions of credits.

He clearly jumped, or was bounced off, when the bike flipped. You nervously scan the surrounding ground and try to determine if by some miracle he is fully intact and just waiting to ambush you. A growing panic sets in when you spot what appears to be a human leg peeking out from behind a rock not far from where the bike clearly hit the ground. You pick a number of rocks and as you get closer launch one at what you hope is Death Bladez’s knee and your assault is met with a muffled yell.\n\nHe struggles to bring himself to his feet and you see a number of wounds including a bone jutting out of his clearly broken leg. His namesake blade has been extended as he screams and hobbles towards you. Most of his words are gibberish, but you make out the gist as he swears he is going to chop you to pieces and continues to stumble towards you. You’re quick to remind him of the almost endless supply of rocks near you both and start pelting him. You land a few good shots on his head, and though the armour plating keeps his skull safe. The rock barrage finally takes its toll and causes him to misstep and he falls, screaming into the sand, as his fractured leg twist in a different direction than the rest of him.\n\nHe lays whining and whimpering into the sand and you start to turn to head for the goal when you feel a rising anger in your gut. You think off all the desperate contestants he has likely slaughtered just for fun over the years and aren’t sure he should be allowed to live. You grit your teeth and look back at him.

Claire is very aware of the pay difference between being a direct commonwealth employee and a freelance, clearly yourself being a multi-millionaire and nearly the owner of a space ship is indicative of what can be achieved.  Claire is quite clear that money is not the key motivator, it is the freedom of freelancing that appeals and Claire says she would like to become a bounty hunter. Before joining the Commonwealth Intelligence Directorate (CID) she was a senior detective in the Anti Organised Crime directorate, then a field operations agent for CID. Claire is certainly a capable operator and while infiltration is the key earner you had plenty of chats with Jane about expanding your operations, doing less infiltration work and more other planetary operations. The main cost is the ship payments and the fuel, more operations is not going to affect that.

As you get closer you shoot them all in the head, to make sure they are all dead and destroy all implant evidence.  For your own benefit you take the crypto key from the CEO, and being fully naked with a lack of options you stuff it into your pussy.  You then make one of the hardest decisions of your life and that is to drop the gun, you know from your special forces days that holding a gun you will be shot automatically. As a naked female, probably a whore they are likely to save the ammunition, you are also an expert infiltrator and can probably pick a good route out of here, probably…..\n\nMiraculously you do manage to escape the building and find yourself in the street with a blanket wrapped around you.  The local security forces nearby have put up a perimeter around the building where looking up you see a hornet’s nest of drones, now not fighting, who won out you will never know but Xena troops are all over the place, lots of Evictors.  When the local security forces are told to disperse they do so, they do so and give you a ride out of this warzone.  You are taken to a warehouse where you explain that you were in a lower floor of he building and don’t need protection, or are a VIP and you are let go.  \n\nYou return to your apartment and sit there for some time looking at the CryptoKey, it must be really important, an ornate rectangle device the size of a child’s fist.  Something that you wedged in your abused pussy for at least 30 mins. You are sure you could sell it back to Xena for a huge price, but it would be bloody risky. If it was at the centre of that attack, certainly an ‘’if’’, then it will carry a lot of risk.  That style of overt attack has been unheard of, corporate wars have always been in the shadows, a discreet cat and mouse game.  Not the out and out warfare that happened tonight.\n\nYou don’t sleep all night and just watch the news after leaving a cryptic message to Jane, as all comms traffic is going to be heavily scrutinised.  You could have told Jane everything by encrypted traffic, but that could bring more scrutiny that it is worth. The news changes as the night goes on, until it concludes that an explosion was seen in a space quarter penthouse, with a number of people injured.  There were too many people in that hotel for it to be kept under wraps for long, a good number will be wealthy people who will book space travel off planet.  The corporations that run the planet will keep it under tabs for a few weeks, then will announce it to the Commonwealth, then all hell will break loose as the Commonwealth start their investigation.  Maybe a month then the planet could end up under martial law.\n\nFuck, doubly fuck. What now?

Mechs were often programmed to use non-lethal force to try to disable and capture intruders to be taken in for questioning.

Either of these weapons could still cause injury and armored sports equipment and rules were required to keep things safe. Neither were very close to the real art of swordsmanship and they ended up being sports where you aimed for a 'touch'.\n\nThe advancement of technology has opened up realistic sword fighting without the risk of death or disfigurement. Lightweight armored sensor suits and composite, weight accurate swords combined with computer based scoring meant that hits could be scored based on the power, accuracy and effectiveness of the cut. Gone were the days of designated target areas and scoring victory by a mere tap.\n\nEquipment was very expensive and the closest most people could get to this was virtual reality simulations. These appeared realistic, with selectable level of blood and gore, until you hit your opponent with your sword and met no resistance.\n\nOwners of the sensor suits could combine the virtual reality feed with physical fighting, superimposing a virtual model with computer calculated injuries and wounds on the opponent. Simulations could go as far as stiffening up joints in the suit, restricting the use of an arm or a leg based on the damage, or decrease the overall mobility to simulate blood loss until the suit locks up completely and the match is ended. The suits even allow electronic pain inducers to be built into make the fights feel more realistic as the anticipation of pain made for a much more realistic bouts.\n\nThe system came with a number of predefined characters but you could also easily make a scan of yourself during a practice sessions and build an accurate representation of yourself down to real time facial expressions. Some people favour the generic characters as they felt uneasy with having their own lookalike hacked in pieces.\n\nThe base software came with three distinct fighting styles built in: medieval combat, classical western fencing, and Japanese kenjutsu.\n\nGenerally, you preferred the Japanese kenjutsu. Medieval fighting was too much like a wrestling match, fencing felt like poking a pincushion, whereas kenjutsu offered decisive one hit matches.

Tyrone walks over to you and you again pivot to keep your back to him, and your body towards the majority of the smugglers. Keeping your back to him causes Tyrone to hesitate slightly, you reach out your hand behind you and give his hard cock a little squeeze.  \n\nAny hesitation on his part evaporates when you grasp his manhood, both hands reach around and fondle your tits, quickly pulling the crop top leaving your tits exposed for the second time. The crowd roar as Tyrone gives your tits some attention and your hand finds its way inside his pants and cups his balls.  Tyrone then reaches down with one hand and cups your pubic mound as you lean back and gasp, the hand then sinks under your hot pants and a finger slides into your wet slit. The feeling sends shivers through you and you tell Tyrone to fuck you now.\n\nTyrone holds you tight probing your pussy and whispers in your ear; “You need to speak louder, I didn’t hear you!”\n\nTrying not to sound too needy you ask again, louder, almost so the rest of the room can hear, with that Tyrone pulls his hand from your pussy and releases his grip.  You step forwards disengage your hand from his cock and pull your hot pants downs and kick them off.  The crop tops comes off and you look over your shoulder at Tyrone, one foot steps onto a small stool as Tyrone lifts you up and you wrap one arm around his shoulders while he spreads your legs and holds the bottom of your thighs. With help from your spare hand he slips his cock inside you, taking you from behind in a show of strength.  Tyrone starts to roughly fuck you in front of all the smugglers, those behind you now all in front, taking in the very intimate porn show view. \n\nYou take some of your weight with one foot on the stool, the other leg, semi supported by Tyrone jerks with every thrust into you, your tits bounce and you groan.  As Tyrone builds into a tempo, thrusts harder, deeper and more powerful you encourage him more, telling him to keep fucking you, that it feels so GOOOD……\n\nIt does not seem long before Tyrone explodes inside you, lifts you up, pulls out and then drops you down onto the floor to a standing ovation of loud cheering. You stand there, panting, spunk and pussy juice running down your leg, looking down at the floor with one leg still on the stool, keeping your legs slightly spread apart.  In any other bar this is when you would be pushed over a table and used like the slut you are, but here, they are still unsure and you can’t make yourself ask for more. You feel slightly sated, the need for sex over, non-sexual thoughts starting to swirl in your mind. \n\nA decision comes in seconds and you pick up the hot pants and clean up your snatch and then brazenly re-dress and head off, saying nothing, treating it as a clinical act. Leaving the incredulous and satisfied Tyrone behind, you just bet his arms will ache tomorrow.\n\n[[Return to Apartment|Apartment]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC85&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;&lt;set $Training = $Training + 3&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $SmugglerTart +=1&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;set $Days = $Days + 0.5&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $SH to 3&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Dracis3D" tags="" created="201511221225" modifier="twee" twine-position="1270,150">&lt;img src=data/dracis3d.png&gt;&lt;h2&gt;On the Web&lt;/h2&gt;Deviant Art Page (Pictures)\nhttp://dracis3d.deviantart.com/\n\nWebsite\nhttp://dracis3d.net/\n\nIGDB - Hosted by TF Gamesite (Will always host the latest public version)\nhttp://tfgamessite.com/index.php?module=viewgame&amp;id=776 \n\nEmail (For ranting and raving)\ndracis3d@gmail.com</div><div tiddler="CL1.1" tags="" created="201611032126" modifier="twee" twine-position="150,6730">Getting into the back office of the joint was easy, there was no real security and you slipped in through an open fire exit. The building was practically deserted and even the front end bar only had a few customers. You suppose the only benefit of the place is for the Spymaster to have a quiet chat with an informant. A drink in the bar perhaps then slip into the behind bar area with no witnesses. The question for you is wear to wait, do you prowl the corridors or sit tight somewhere?\n\nThe other problem is you are not sure there is anyone here? Taking your chances you decide to have a look round and scout at the place, after all you can always make a break for the fire exit and make good your escape.  Again there is no-one around but then you hear footsteps, looking at your options you duck into the staff toilets and get into a stall. You wait in a cubicle for a safe time, then head to the door leading back to the corridor. Hearing no-one nearby you open the door and step out in the corridor. Straining slightly you can hear a couple of men talking, you edge closer and hear one of the men say to follow him into the basement, so that they can talk in private.\n\nYou wait for a few more minutes and hear the men walking off, three of them you think judging by the footsteps.  You hear a key rattling and a door opening and then footsteps down a set of stairs. Waiting for the sounds to fade away you head to the basement entrance, looking down you feel a sense of trepidation and then walk soundlessly down the stairs. Years of experience enable you to make little noise. The bottom of the stairs ends in a corridor with a number of storage rooms, voices can be heard from one of the rooms and you inch closer. You hear a man talking about Dragon Gang movements and you feel a moment of happiness, you have found your mark. You just have three men to deal with, one a bodyguard no doubt, the spymaster who is no fighter and the other an informant who is unlikely to put up a fight. \n\n&lt;&lt;if $Weapons3 is 1&gt;&gt;You have the neuro baton which will be perfect for stunning them all quickly. &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You decide to have a quick scout around in the other rooms to see if you can find a makeshift weapon to club the targets unconscious. You find a crow bar which will do. &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; As you are getting ready to ambush the Spymaster you hear footsteps above you, rattling on the floorboards. A good 3 or 4 people are now upstairs and you wonder if you should abort the mission as you may have to deal with those above. You then hear the basement door being closed and locked, you briefly wonder why, knowing that they unlocked it downstairs, then you hear a voice.\n\n“Come in, I know you are there” says the man you assume is the Spymaster.\n\nYou do not reply and stay still, not wishing to admit your presence. \n\n“Look Trish, I know you are there, you have been setup and locked in this basement. I have two trained fighters with me, with guns and you are just a lovely little girl”.\nWhat do you do?\n\n[[Charge in, making the most of any confusion|CL1.1A]]\n\n[[Try and bluff your way out of this, after all you are not Trish|CL1.1B]]\n</div><div tiddler="CL1.3" tags="Stat_94" created="201611222131" modifier="twee" twine-position="710,6730">Alex spots your gaze and smiles “Relax babe, this is just a little reminder right, just a little tease to get you in the mind-set that talking to the boss is a good idea”.  With that he starts to collect a few items and comes back with a knife.\n\nShrinking back in your chains you try and look scared, not overly hard in this case as you are clearly very worried, chained up in a basement with a kinky gang member. Alex comes right up to you and speaks again;\n\n“Babe, you know how many girls have kneed me, or tried to, you know this knife could really mess up your pretty face, I think you are a clever one, you know that you must submit, right?”\n\nHolding the knife close to your face the other hand runs up the outside of your thigh, up your hips and waist and stops at your armpit and returns down.\n\n“Tell me you want to be naked Trisha” he purrs into your ear, cruelly holding eye contact.\n\nYou tell him you want to be naked, to which you get no reply. You then say it again and are told to say please Alex. You do so again and are rewarded when he cuts your bra straps, then still holding the knife reaches behind you and unclasps the bra. To give him room you automatically press your chest into him to give him more access to your back. This delights him and you are complimented on being good. Alex then tells you that most spies are not far of being whores, happy to use their own bodies. Others believe so strongly in the cause, they act like men, trying to be defiant to the end. Alex tells you he enjoys both types. As he stands close to you, you can feel his erection pressing in to you. Not trying to be obvious you move your hips slightly across him. \n\nStill holding the position his hands reach down and grab your buttocks and give them a squeeze. \n\n“Aww babe, the boss wants to interrogate you in 20 mins time, but I so want to fuck you, watching you strip and get into the restraints has given me the biggest boner for a long time, you are one in a million” he speaks quietly to you. \n\nAlex then steps away and hooks your thong with his free hand, his knuckles brush your pubic hair and lips while he pushes your thong down to mid thighs. Alex then takes over with his foot until they are around your ankles.  Alex then holds your gaze for a minute and looks at the damp patch on the back of his hand. Alex gives you a knowing look, a shared secret gaze that he knows you are getting off on this before telling you to step out of your thong.\n\nAlex then picks up your thong and asks you what you think is coming next, slightly unsure of your words you open your mouth to speak but find your damp panties stuffed in your mouth. Tasting your own arousal you feel a touch of shame and watch as Alex walks over to the table where the chains and other items brought in were dumped. Alex picks up two items which he conceals in the palm of his hands.\n\n“Babe, so now we have to apply a few reminders”, with that he brandishes the items held in his hands. Alex holds a pair of nipple clamps in front of your face and steps forward putting one in his pocket. With a grip on your breast he attaches the first clamp, and then the second. Admiring his handiwork for a second he then tightens them one by one, stopping when he gets an anguished grunt from you. Then he walks off and gets a collar, attaching it to your neck, and then fastening a chain to the front. The chain dangles down between your legs and pools on the floor. Alex smiles and tells you that it will go through your legs and will be attached to the collar. Alex demonstrates by pulling the chain between your legs and makes an effort to rub your pussy again, finding it wet. \n\nAlex then goes to the other men and a hushed conversation starts, you hear snippets of favours and unattended playing with prisoners is not allowed until the boss says so.  But in the end an agreement is reached and the two men walk out, leaving you alone with Alex. \n\nAlex then comes over to you and tells you that he will make life a lot better for you if you fuck him. Alex tells you that he has to pull the crotch rope tight but can do lots to make your life better. You can’t reply with the panties in your mouth and Alex after inserting a finger into your wet hole tells you he can’t take them out in case you moan. Alex quickly releases the wrist cuffs and you rub your wet pussy on his leg, like a bitch in heat. Alex laughs and says Aruba must have got you from a whore slaver judging by your behaviour. This however is the end for Alex &lt;&lt;if $Weapon1 is 1&gt;&gt;as your fingernail blades sever the arteries in his neck.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;as you attack with a set of blows and chops that soon take him down. When he is down you wrap the collar chain round his neck and choke the life out of him.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n\nWith Alex’s corpse on the ground you pull out the panties from your mouth and unbuckle the collar. You then quickly get the crop top, pants and boots on. Dressed minus your underwear you collect the &lt;&lt;if $Weapon3 is 1&gt;&gt;the neuro pulse baton&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; crow bar&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; and ambush the two men who were with Alex.  You pick up your discarded thong and stuff it into your pocket. \n\nWith no-one else appearing in the basement, you slowly make your way upstairs into the back office area and explore. You are now equipped with two pistols liberated from Alex’s mates.\n\n[[An unexpected re-appearance|CL1.4]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC94&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;&lt;set $Training = $Training + 2&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="CL1.2" tags="" created="201611222039" modifier="twee" twine-position="570,6730">You feel like resisting but instead you try to look like a scared girl, your only hope is to get them to underestimate you and you may get out of here. The mission is probably going to be a failure now, but your life is something you want to keep. The promises of joining their gang, you don’t believe them, they will want to drop off your dead body as a message to not mess with them. \n\nOne man enjoys the look of fear on your face, and pulls his hand back as if he is going to slap you. You cringe, Trisha is a real person, you met her at Aruba and she is a good spy, no skills whatsoever on the combat front and now these Delta people think they have Trisha captured. The thing is Trisha is a blonde, shorter and not at all athletic. You wonder to yourself whether you have been set up, but why?\n\nThe spymaster tells you he is going upstairs but points to a man behind you, Alex he says will help loosen your tongue. You are told to look around and crane your neck to see a very happy man. Alex you are told loves his craft, the spymaster does not like Alex’s ways, but he can get a drink while you hang out with Alex. With that he chuckles at his own little joke and walks out. Before you can do or say anything two men grab your arms and pull you out of the chair, you are then dragged into another room and are surprised to find the handcuffs being taken off. Once the cuffs are off you are pushed into the centre of the room and the three men that came with you step back to the doorway. The door is then closed.\n\nYou stand there surprised, no groping, chaining you up, ripping your clothes off or other action. Instead they take you to a room, lock you in there with no handcuffs. You take a look around the room and spot a camera, a speaker and a collection of cuffs and chains. The speaker crackles into life…\n\n“Trish, I want you to strip down to your underwear”.\n\nYou are stood there in a crop top, bra, tight pants and boots. You decided to blend in with the crowd and go for a casual outfit. You pause for a bit and then ask what happens if you don’t.\n\n“Don’t be defiant Trisha, you need to be less defiant, do you think they are coming to rescue you, we have a mole on the inside Trisha” he tells you chuckling to himself. \n\nYou stand there wondering and Alex continues saying that you need to understand that Aruba is finished, co-operating is your only choice. You agonize on the decision but decide to remove your crop top, your boots and then your pants. Leaving you in a black thong and bra looking at the camera. &lt;&lt;if $Weapon2 is 1&gt;&gt;You have the knife in your boot, hidden so a casual look would not see it. You hope that a casual look is all it gets.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n\n“Now look behind you and attach your wrists to the cuffs on the wall, face away from the wall” says Alex, again in a neutral voice. \n\nYou turn around and look at the wall, two hooks embedded in the wall have chains and wrist cuffs. If you leant back on the wall and lifted your arms up, you could get them in the restraints. One would be easy, but the second would be quite hard with one arm restrained. What the hell is happening here, some thug from a gang is asking you to self-restrain yourself, do they know who you really are, hence they are taking it careful? They can’t know this, the whole conversation would be different wouldn’t it? They would be talking to you about killing Michael Benz, and finishing the Dragon Gang leadership. Wanting some answers and not wanting to think on this for too long you decide to follow the instructions.\n\nAs you lie back on the wall, you note that the camera is pointed straight at you. Alex and the others are clearly watching you and the mike is on, you hear some heavy breathing and for a second you wonder if you heard the speaker or your own breathing. There is a part of you enjoying offering submitting to these men, watching you on the camera. You lift your arms up and holding the cuff in one hand you snap your wrist into it. As it goes taunt your arm takes a ‘surrender’ position, elbow bent 90 degrees. Your other arm reaches out and gets your wrist into the cuff, you then a long minute trying to get it snap closed by pushing it into the wall. Eventually it snaps shut. Both arms hang in the surrender position. \n\nNo noise comes out of the speaker but the door opens and Alex and one other man walks in.\n\n“Wow Trish, you look amazing” he compliments you, looking you up and down. “Good move, you see you need to be in the right mental state for a talk with the boss, some need to be sent into a world of pain, some need to be bribed, and some just need to understand that they are no longer in charge, and on the losing team”. Alex carries on that Aruba are close to being wiped out, and from what you know he is right. If there best agent is being ratted out, then clearly Aruba are finished. But you are not their best agent, you misinformed on you? The question is bugging you.\n\nYou stand there saying nothing and your gaze follows the third man returning with a collection of chains and other items.\n\n[[Wait and see|CL1.3]]\n</div><div tiddler="CL1.5" tags="" created="201611032131" modifier="twee" twine-position="990,6730">The call from Michael Benz comes in at exactly 2 hours and starts with a lot of praise and the spymaster needed little persuasion to talk when they said you would be interrogating him if he did not comply.  The flattery is nice but when Michael trails off you abruptly and flatly tell him that they were tipped off that Trisha Kendrick was coming. \n\nThere is a little silence then Michael opens up and says it was the only way to get the spymaster out of hiding, to get his elusive quarry. You rip into him saying he could have told you, or sent Trisha as the bait and he has no right keeping you out of the loop. Michael apologizes and offers you more money, you came through unscathed, this part of the mission was successful and you can always get your revenge later on the smug bastard. So you let it lie, and instead discuss the next part. \n\nCapturing the spymaster was the easier part, the spymaster was just elusive and travelled with a small discreet, now deceased bodyguard team. The next task is to kill the leader of the Dragon Gang and place the guilt at the door of the cartel. The leadership contest for the Dragon gang will be messy and their immediate attention will be revenge. As the two gangs rip themselves to pieces Aruba can slowly rebuild and make some acquisitions. \n\nYour opportunity is a Dragon gang celebration and you really have two choices, go in armed to the teeth or sneak in and join the girls hired in for the event as ornaments. There is one condition though, the Dragon Gang leader has to die by the sword for the ultimate insult as all the Dragon Gang leadership are skilled with the blade. \n\nBut the first thing that you need to is to get some intel on the Dragon Gang HQ. The suggested option is Aruba have a contact where you get a security job at a nightclub, get hold of datapads or access cards and the Magnum's high tech hacking systems should be able to produce you an access card to their building. You just need to get close enough to a suitable target and keep them engaged long enough.\n\n[[Onwards to the new job|CL1.6]]\n</div><div tiddler="CL1.4" tags="" created="201611222222" modifier="twee" twine-position="850,6730">Slinking down two hallways with the outline of the nipple clamps visible through your crop top you hear the voice of the spymaster. Peeking round the corner you see the spymaster on his own reading a datapad. \n\nThe spymaster is stood up with one leg forwards and as you charge into the room you lash out with a violent kick you bring your foot into contact with the Spymaster’s nuts, dropping him to his knees, quickly followed up with a solid boot to the face.  Hearing the noise the spymasters bodyguard comes around the corner and stops, shock etched across his face at the scene.  The poor reactions result in the man being shot. The gunshots bring more people running in to be shot in quick succession. Knowing that there are at least two more you grab another gun and as you expected another three come running up the corridor and go the same way as the others.  You quickly finish off the wounded and head back to the Spymaster, you reckon your best bet is to make a dash to the vehicle you have parked around the back. You quickly handcuff the Spymaster’s hands behind his back and has he starts to come round you stuff your thong in his mouth. You reload the pistols, stuff one in your pants, and put one on the floor while you pick up the spymaster in a firemans lift. Once he is on your shoulder you collect the pistol and make a dash for the back entrance you came in from. \n\nLuckily you do not encounter anyone else and got the spymaster into the boot of your vehicle. Once away from the bar you call up the Aruba support team for a place to meet. You had no desire to head back to the Aruba base of operations, not being sure how this mess came about. There was a leak somewhere.\n\nYou get to the meet location and park the car in the garage, there are a couple of Aruba people there but none of the heavies you would expect if this was a setup. None of the management either, which hints that they don’t want to be near you. You open the boot and you hear some chuckles as you present the spymaster, your thong still in his mouth. One of the men asks if that is ladies underwear in his mouth and you tell him it is yours. You chuckle at the implied question and the expression on the man’s face and locked in your gaze he lowers it to your chest then quickly looks away.\n\nClearly he has seen the nipple clamps and you feel the urge to give them back, lifting your top up you take both the nipple clamps off to the stunned silence of the Aruba people. You head over to the spymaster and lifting his top you apply the clamps telling him quietly that they are your gift. You then pull down his pants and point out the rapidly purpling and swollen ball bag and upper thigh. The result of our spreader bar. \n\nNow aware of your nipples and down from your adrenalin rush you don’t explain to the men what happened, just that the spymaster is looking forward to fucking Trisha Kendrick, but probably not today you finish with an amused laugh. You tell them that the boss better phone you in 2 hours.\n\n[[Take a break and wait for the call|CL1.5]]\n</div><div tiddler="CL1.7" tags="" created="201611071121" modifier="twee" twine-position="1970,6730">You have now landed the search role and your role is to run a metal detector and other search systems on the VIP guests and bodyguards entering the facility. The task proves exceedingly boring and frustrating when suitable targets go through the system too quickly. Basically you are trying to hack a device which has a close proximity communications system, as soon as the gangster is more than 10 feet away you are out of luck.\n\nBut lady luck does shine on you, one gangster fails the scans and is asked to agree to a physical search. At that he gets angry but when he looks round the room and spots you, says that you can do it. The team supervisor says you can and calls you through your radio, saying whatever you do, keep him happy. As you get closer the gangster tells you that searching is shoes and feet is the place to start as he would normally carry a knife down there. You get to your knees and feel the gangster’s gaze on your cleavage. \n\nWhile he cooperates by taking his shoes off, he slowly moves forward until his groin is basically touching your face, he calls out to his companions that this is the position he normally takes with girls like you. To make the point he pulls your head in slightly until it touches your groin, not pushing his luck too far he quickly releases you as pushing his luck too far would risk a club ban. But the point is made and his tipsy companions laugh. The rest of the search carries on with making remarks on how sensually you are searching him. Halfway through the search you are rewarded with a success, the Magnum has broken the encryption and you can now create an access card. This encourages you to actually drop some of the professional search skills, and make the whole thing more erotic, you step in to him so he can feel your tits pressing in to him. You pull short of totally making yourself a tease as he will take it as a challenge and demand that you please him in the VIP area, you suspect management would agree, treading a fine line between the corporate safety and the low level employee danger. The manager can ban people from the club with impunity, sat behind the corporate security, but the bar staff and security? They would not have the same level of protection unless a gang were really provocative. \n\n[[Getting ready for the last part|CL1.8]]\n</div><div tiddler="Day1" tags="" created="201410190731" modifier="twee" twine-position="3930,10">&lt;h3&gt;Evindium City Downtown - Five hours later&lt;/h3&gt;You arrive at the apartment that Sid has provided for you. It’s your new home for the hopefully not-so-long stay on this planet. You know that you have to keep your distance from the ship and Jane in order to avoid drawing attention to them. The only good news is that you arrived with the data core without encountering a single issue so you immediately start the process of uploading the contents to Sid over an encrypted channel and wait.\n\nThe upload still has about thirty minutes to go, so you decide to use the time to check out the local news and find out more about the new neighborhood you're in on the planetary net.\n\nYou are engrossed in your reading when the console lets out a chime indicating the upload has completed successfully. This is quickly followed by a second chime signaling an incoming transmission from Sid.\n\n&quot;Celeste,&quot; Sid says, picking up. &quot;The data came through and I am transferring it to the client as we speak. Standby.&quot; After a moment, Sid let out a small, satisfied sigh. &quot;Ok the transfer is complete and the client is extremely pleased; they really did not think this job was possible. This puts me in a great mood as well as this was top-tier clientele.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good. I am glad this mess was worth it to you,&quot; you say, exhausted by the entire ordeal.\n\n&quot;I have transferred the payment to the usual bank accounts as requested,&quot; Sid continues. &quot;I made sure one of the wires was the promised thousand credits to your local account. I've also taken the liberty of paying off the apartment’s rent for the next three months.\n\n&quot;As for the Hugo 'problem', I identified a leak in my organization and the matter is being dealt with, but it appears someone wants to remove me from the market. This might not surprise you as there's plenty of competition in this line of work but this means that there may be others who know about you. Hugo was a trusted agent I’ve used repeatedly in the past, yet someone still offered him a sum large enough to change his loyalties which is concerning. Few people have pockets that deep or would find it worth the cost to do so.\n\n&quot;I should mention that Hugo had extensive cybernetic modifications done on his body so I hope he fell from a great height when he took his plummet. Otherwise, he's probably still alive. If he is, hopefully he’s so severely damaged he won’t be able to recover or transmit his location any longer,&quot; he says with a grimace. \n\nYou consider the fact you could have one more problem now and consider smashing the console in frustration before you finally respond.\n\n&quot;So what you are saying is that a crazed cyborg, massively pissed off by having to crawl across the planet for who knows how long, may turn up to come after me sooner or later?&quot; you ask in disbelief. &quot;Knowing my luck too, it will be sooner if his current employer deems it economically viable and decides to find and salvage what's left of him. They already clearly dropped quite a bit of money into buying him off.&quot;\n\n&quot;Which means that it isn’t that big of a stretch. You got it,&quot; he replies &quot;More than likely there is a support team for Hugo stationed somewhere on the planet. Luckily the leak on this end was found before I rented this apartment, otherwise I expect you would have met them by now.&quot;\n\n&quot;One last thing, Celeste.

Getting caught stealing from a hyper market will get you banned and your store card revoked. As companies opened up to sharing data, this could mean that you would end up banned from all the larger chains and were at the mercy of black market.\n\nIt was the same with driving, as all of the vehicles required you to enter an identification card before you could operate them. Getting caught committing a road offence by the traffic surveillance and road maintenance system put you on their blacklist and prevent you from operating future vehicles.\n\nStreet violence was not tolerated in areas controlled by security forces but was largely ignored everywhere else. The wealthy simply stayed out of the dangerous areas or hired personal bodyguards when needed. The middle class paid for apartment block security or lived in suburban, gated communities.\n\nThe Commonwealth Court Service provides an adjudication service for civil disputes such as breaches of contract.  The Commonwealth Justicar and Justice Forces provide guidance for standards of security services for public areas, investigates, and at times steps in if things are going badly wrong.

You reckon that by being in the receiving end, you can also get some learning on how to be the dominant partner.\n\nCarla suggests four options; a light bondage session, anal training, orgasm control and pussy worship.  Carla gives her rationale for all of them, the bondage session is just so you can see the possibilities between consenting partners. Anal training on the basis that you might not be too experienced in that area, and it can save you some possible discomfort.\n\nWith orgasm training Carla smiles at you deviously, and tells you that sometimes you might want to pretend, when you are really into it and close anyway.  You get that, lately you have been loving your sex too much, too many orgasms and you need to have a sleep for a bit, not good if you need to fight! With the pussy worship Carla notes that you have had a number of lesbian encounters and have probably been eaten out, and gone down on a good few girls, but she reckons she can teach you some stuff.\n\nTime to choose, Carla says she can fit you in for two sessions, with a recovery time in-between.

You turn around and give him your most disgusted, pleading look and then face forwards again. As expected the officer likes having power over women and your look just served to encourage him more. Instead of another pinch, he puts his right hand onto your ass cheek and starts to massage it. This serves to enrage you and you involuntarily clench your butt cheek which makes the officer chuckle and firmly squeeze your butt. You find yourself in an odd position: you are enraged, but strangely turned on by the situation.\n\nThe metro train then starts to slow down for the next station and to catch your balance you step forwards. As the officer gets his balance from an overhead bar his hand pushes down and then off your ass. This gives you a great opportunity for an elbow strike to the ribs which you carry out.

Most of her strikes have been within a centimetre on each cheek and they are slowly starting to sting.\n\n''THWACK''\n\nCarla stops her assault and for a brief moment you wonder why. You then feel a cool bead of wetness drip and run down your thigh.\n\n&quot;You seem to be enjoying your beating, Celeste,&quot; she says with a chuckle. You start to rise from the desk and your backside is immediately struck and forces you back down. &quot;I didn't say you could get up now, did I? You're turning out to be quite the little masochist, too.&quot;\n\nYou open your mouth to protest but with perfect timing Carla runs her finger over through your juices and over your clit. As her finger dips into your moist hole you let out a moan instead.\n\n&quot;We aren't here for conventional pleasure today, dear,&quot; Carla says in a teasing tone. &quot;Now spread your legs apart. It is time for the main course.&quot;\n\n&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;MArms2B3&quot;)&gt;&gt;[[Wait for it|Striking Training1A]]\n&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;[[Wait for it|Striking Training1B]] &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Int19.3" tags="" created="201604292243" modifier="twee" twine-position="5190,5470">When you arrive at the hotel and have started your ascent in the lift, Charles starts ripping your Shebo uniform off as he gropes all over your body. Clarice is not-so-subtly watching you two out of the corner of her eye while Bertram simply presses a button and faces the door.\n\n&quot;Now you are going to be a good little fuck doll for me. I can’t wait to see what you can do in private; James said you were insatiable,&quot; he says as he begins to kiss and lick along your collarbones.\n\nYou respond with a giggle and help him remove your clothing and discard them in the lift. A ding announces you’ve reached your destination and you wantonly strut out of the lift past a shocked couple looking to board.\n\n&quot;That’s the stuff, you little minx,&quot; you hear Charles mutter.\n\nBertram heads off to his room but Clarice decides to stay much to Charles amusement. It is clear to you that she normally does not hang around to watch him have his way with his evening pick.\n\n&quot;I thought you only come to these nights out to keep other career girls away so your jobs safe,&quot; he jests at Clarice. Like at Shebo’s, she smiles to his face but a dirty look appears as soon as he has turned his back.\n\nWhen you enter the luxury suite he is staying in, you listen to Clarice and Charles talking. He reckons she has had too much to drink but she is quick to let him know Shebo was hot and she wants a piece of your ass. Charles laughs and says she definitely has had too much to drink and any girl staying in his suite is getting fucked by him. When Clarice says nothing back, he slaps her ass and says that he is definitely sure she’s drunk.\n\nYou head straight into the bedroom and sit on the bed and wait. Charles takes in your curves and tells Clarice that tonight its ladies first while he makes up his mind who is going to fuck first. You take the initiative and head over to Clarice and kiss her passionately on the lips while running your hand down her back and unzipping her cocktail dress. You pull on the straps and the dress falls to the floor revealing only a lace push-up bra.\n\nYou smile and whisper into her ear, &quot;I know you dumped your panties at Shebo’s and what made you so wet.&quot; This sets Clarice off and she tears off her bra, breaking the strap, then pulls you down on top of her on the bed.\n\nYour hands explore each other and your tongues entwine leaving you only slightly aware of Charles stripping as he watches. Clarice has been waiting a long time for release and you soon find your head shoved down between her legs. You tease her until she pins your head with her thighs and grinds her hips into your face. You try and take your time but it is all too easy to send her over the edge. Clarice climaxes and breaks into orgasmic shudders just as you feel Charles hand slapping and grabbing your ass cheeks.\n\n&quot;My turn,&quot; demands Charles. &quot;It’s time for you to lick our guest out while I fuck your cunt, Clarice. Go ahead and queen her, Celeste.&quot;\n\n[[Do as you are told|Int19.4]]</div><div tiddler="Int19.4" tags="" created="201604220812" modifier="twee" twine-position="5330,5470">You get off Clarice while Charles drags the petite girl to the edge of the bed and kneels on a cushion before taking her roughly. He then gestures for you to sit on her lips while still facing towards him.\n\n&quot;This bitch likes to know I’m in charge,&quot; growls Charles as he slowly increases the force of his thrusts into her.\n\nWith that he reaches out with both arms and grabs a breast in each hand, alternating between the pair of you. You ride Clarice’s face with your wet slit and you aren’t surprised that she is as attentive in bed as she’d be during her work. You shift your weight, grinding against her face while enjoying the attention being given to your breasts. Charles suddenly pinches one of your nipples to get your attention and tells you to put your weight down on Clarice’s face and smother her now that he is alternating which of her holes he is fucking. It does not take much longer until he grunts and fills her ass full of his cum. He pulls his cock from her ass and you to lean forward and lick it clean. Clarice redoubles her efforts and your legs nearly give out as you have your first orgasm of the evening.\n\nYou get off Clarice and look down at what your wet pussy has done to her makeup. While still looking good herself, her mascara is running from beneath her eyes. One of her eyelash extensions has shifted, her eye shadow is smudged, and her entire upper lip is of stripped of color; you’re sure your inner thighs look like an abstract mural. Charles dons a dressing gown and allows Clarice to wear one too but tells you to remain naked and to sit on the floor. He and Clarice sit on the sofa while he recovers and you talk about his favourite subject, himself and the show. You provide a steady stream of compliments and alcohol to keep the conversation flowing.\n\nThe night soon follows a pattern of you get fucked which is followed by another round of drinking. To keep Charles enthusiasm up you get sex aides sent up to the room and demonstrate athletic, exotic positions for his pleasure. His gains result in you getting snippets of what the Evindium show is going to include and eventually he falls asleep in a drunken stupor. Clarice surprises you with her tolerance throughout all of this and remains reasonably alert.\n\nShe checks Charles and gives him a quick and hard slap. When this gets no reaction apart from a twitch of his brow and a mumble, she looks over at you then sits down across from you on the floor.\n\n&quot;Now that the pig is asleep, I’d like you to tell me your aim in all of this. You have been getting the egotistical prick say far too much over the course of the evening,&quot; she reveals as she stares you down. &quot;Luckily for you his dick has taken over his thinking but I work in media and manipulating people is part of my skills so it was obvious. Tell me what is going on or I’ll contact security.&quot;  \n\n[[Take your time before replying|Int19.5]]</div><div tiddler="Int19.5" tags="" created="201607280240" modifier="twee" twine-position="4770,5610">&quot;Let’s say, hypothetically speaking, that I represent someone looking to win the show in a spectacular, media friendly manner,&quot; you purr.\n\nClarice looks you over and seems pleased when she responds.\n\n&quot;An episode with really good ratings and a winner’s payout could mean success for me and bad news for Charles after he has paid out a few too many times this season. If profits are not great, Charles gets the axe and I’ll have a chance to move up. Either way the show should receive top of the ratings if I were to help you. Then, even if things go poorly for this someone for any reason, I’m still doing my job at least,&quot; she finishes with a smile.\n\n&quot;That is my thinking as well,&quot; you reply and smile, knowing full well by now that she hates Charles with a passion.\n\nShe then explains that she will sit with Charles but you might find his datapad very interesting.  She is not told the game’s plan until just before it starts but Charles receives up to date copies of the show’s plans for approval. You find the datapad and its encryption is soon broken by a comms link connection with the Magnum. Soon streams of data heading to the Magnum for analysis and five minutes later Jane calls back saying it looks good. You rejoin Clarice and have a celebratory kiss and drink when you tell her you found just what you needed.\n\nJust when you are thinking of getting some rest, the apartment door opens and a really muscular man enters the room. You have a slight lurch of fear thinking that you may have triggered some alarm but the man laughs when he sees Charles before his eyes fall onto you. Clarice introduces him as Mark, a hunter on the show, but she’s unable to reveal his stage name. Mark speaks to her briefly and heads off after announcing he will speak to Charles about something that interests him in the morning.\n\nClarice tells you that Mark is one of Charles favourite hunters and an ass kisser to boot. While some hunters would have tried it on, Mark will only have a go at Charles girls if he’s given permission. Between the pair of you, you both carry Charles to one side of the bed and Clarice joins you on the other side to further test your stamina until you both pass out in each other’s arms.\n\nWhen Charles wakes in the morning he takes a number of pills to revitalize himself but you’re surprised when he forgoes the pleasure of fucking you again. He seems equally surprised to find Clarice still in the room but finds it funny that she got her piece of ass; he was worried she was getting a bit frigid. He and Clarice have meetings to attend and you are given a robe to wear while you make your way down a few floors and get payment from his assistant.\n\nCharles finds it amusing that the dressing gown is a little short and barely covers your pussy and ass cheeks. You walk out unbothered by the risk of exposure and head to the assistant’s room. He keeps you waiting momentarily before answering the door. \n\nYou know that this step is unnecessary but Charles says that his assistant likes to see the women he partakes in. When you arrive, the assistant looks you over with an invasive stare before speaking up.\n\n&quot;Ahh. Quite the amazon type, yet trained like an elite sex slave; the boss gave you high praise. He will book you again before he leaves and Sir Mark also wants to book you for a quickie,&quot; he explains dryly. &quot;You will need to purchase some clothing which shouldn’t be an issue after the tip you’ve been left. Please leave after you have showered and dressed.&quot;\n\nThe assistant goes back to a desk but watches you as you use room service to order a set of clothes. Once they are ordered, you head off to the shower and wondering why the man has spent so long trying to see if you would flash your pussy. If he asked, you would probably have fucked him. You shake your head as the warm water starts to run down your body. \n\n//Where the hell did that thought come from?//\n\n[[Wash off and get on your way|Int19.6]]</div><div tiddler="Int19.6" tags="" created="201607280502" modifier="twee" twine-position="4910,5610">When you get back to your apartment, Jane has analyzed the data and has a solid plan with only a fifteen percent chance of you dying a violent death. She has worked out that Mark is the Hunter named ‘The Stalker’ and it would really benefit you if you could implant a proximity detector inside him somehow. Jane has the idea to implant it inside his butt cheek while you’re having sex and you quickly arrange to meet Mark through Charles’s assistant. Now all you have to do is fuck a genetically enhanced man and insert the bug through a finger nail applicator.\n\nYou meet Mark at his hotel room, dressed like an escort with thigh high boots and a short cocktail dress that barely covers your butt and shows lots of cleavage. As it happens, when you enter the hotel foyer you meet the couple who encountered leaving the lift the previous night and are given a knowing look. You don’t even blush at being considered a hooker, nor feel much concern inside. After all, this is just a means to an end.\n\nWhen you meet Mark, he does not waste a second of time. Your dress is hitched up, your panties drop until they hang around one ankle, and you are fucked in the standing missionary position. Mark is in sweat pants and tank top and it is clear he has just come back from the gym. You grab his thrusting ass and you pierce the skin with your applicator and the proximity bug heads in. Mark rewards your apparent aggression by increasing the power of his thrusts, hammering your back against the wall. When he finishes with a primal grunt, he whispers in your ear &quot;You really like it rough, girl,&quot; and you can only give a meek whimper in reply.\n\nWith his cum running down your leg and your panties still dangling from your ankle, he tells you not to move or clean yourself up while he takes a shower. You do as you are told and ten minutes later Mark comes out of the shower with his small, erect cock. He catches your eyes lingering and flexes his impressive musculature to distract you. You almost say tell him that he can get himself enhanced with the sort of money he makes but think better of it. Mark then grabs you by the elbow and drags you to the bedroom. \n\n&quot;You’ve been a fucking bitch,&quot; he berates you. &quot;You’ve drawn my blood and now I’m going to punish you.&quot;\n\nYou see through the facade, knowing that his type gets off on the roleplay of dominating and degrading women. You find yourself on your back, ankles over his shoulders, arms pinned to the bed, getting slammed into by this muscle bound freak. You grind back and clench at his cock and soon you milk him for all he is worth. When Mark pulls out of you, he tells you to remain where you are, legs spread and leaking his cum, while he looks at you.\n\nSeconds later he smiles and reveals that he has an iris camera implant and he will remember this day for weeks to come. Again you hold back the temptation to tell him the money would have been better spent getting surgery for his cock. It’s a same day procedure that is guaranteed to work the next day!\n\n//&quot;Men and their egos...&quot;// you think to yourself. \n\nMark is spent after this and sends you on your way, refusing you the use of his bathroom to clean up. You settle on using your panties to mop up some of the cum plastered to your leg; even your boots have a few stains if anyone pays enough attention. The toilets in the hotel foyer provides an area to clean yourself more thoroughly. With your stiletto boot on the toilet seat, you reach between your legs with a handful of wet toilet tissue and clean yourself a wave of feelings rush over you; anger, resignation, humiliation, and... acceptance?\n\nThe proximity bug in Mark’s butt will likely mean a violent end by your hands or at least a failure on his part as a hunter. You are thrilled by this whole event but you are not sure what excited you the most. You certainly were wet while walking into the hotel foyer earlier and now you are getting a bit hot and bothered again. All you have to do now is register for //Run the Gauntlet// while knowing full well that people like you don’t go on shows like this since they’re too risky... unless you don’t play nice.\n\n[[Head back to your apartment|Apartment]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;NOTE: New Mission Received&lt;/p&gt;

Maddock is uncomfortable with sending you alone and offers to send some of his men along.

Who are you and what will happen if I give you the data core?&quot;\n\n&quot;Let me tell you a story Celeste,&quot; Maddock replies. &quot;You know that [[Evictor mercenaries|Evictor Mercenaries]] were designed by Xena Corp. and probably even that they don’t manufacture them due to regulations on private and corporate militaries. If Xena wants to utilize their talents, they have to hire an Evictor mercenary company the same as anyone else. The reality is that Xena are manufacturing an army in secret. I’m sure you’ll point out that there have been investigations into Xena’s facilities before, but what would happen if they were being aided by an outside party, say, by a mining company?\n\n&quot;Lantis Corporation hate Xena because their operations puts Lantis’s mining at risk,&quot; you quickly reply.\n\n&quot;Ah... That //is// what the public is lead to believe,&quot; he says with a smug grin. &quot;But tell me, Celeste: What if Lantis were creating underground facilities for Xena? After all, most of their mining is already automated and the only need for human input is in the logistics and for mechanical repairs.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then Xena could be building an army of Evictors undetected,&quot; you say as everything starts to fall into place in your head. &quot;The only way you could possibly know all of this is if you aren’t freedom fighter. You are working for the Commonwealth Hall of Justice in an unorthodox manner; maybe even off the books.&quot;\n\n&quot;I need a cover,&quot; he responds, his tone implying some surprise you pieced it together so quickly. &quot;Xena are too good at spotting Commonwealth agents. I do my part by running a shabby operation that is a nuisance for them, knowing that past the jumpgate everything is mainly under their control!&quot;\n\nYou nod. You aren’t overly surprised because you have been part of a number of less than moral missions for government. What is surprising is that the ingenuity of it all as it has people like Mr. Grayson believing and participating in it. Before you ponder further, Maddock continues.\n\n&quot;We think Lantis and Xena are pooling their efforts and we don’t know for what reason. I won’t share what I speculate is happening but this data core could shed some light on things. So, //Miss Blake//, are you in?&quot;\n\nYou pause, weighing up the risks\n\n&quot;Celeste we have done some background checks,&quot; Maddock says trying to prompt you. &quot;I know you are a very wealthy New Terra resident, but do you only care about money? You could work for us. We could protect you while you help prevent the corporations from carrying out these heinous activities unchecked.&quot;\n\n&quot;I will provide the data core on the condition that either you or Claire leads the investigation into the contents and you make sure I’m the first to know what you find,&quot; you respond sternly. &quot;I will also consider joining your group depending on what sort of information you find inside the data core.&quot;\n\nYou think Jane will approve as she was never sure how she felt about going freelance but needed the chance at extra money to help her ailing parents who could not afford their medical treatments.

Could you do me a favour?&quot; your voice calls out dripping with arousal.\n\n&quot;Sure, lady. What can I do for you?!&quot; he asks excitedly.\n\n&quot;Get your cock out,&quot; you whisper, &quot;because it’s his lucky day,&quot; you announce to the entire room. Tyrone looks at you unsure if you’re kidding around, but as you reach down and pull the top of his pants down exposing his underwear you’re sure your intentions are clear.\n\nKnowing you are serious he hurriedly undoes his pants, pulls them down, and out springs his erect cock. Grabbing the base of his throbbing shaft with your right hand, you step over the chair so you are astride the man, and with your left hand pull your panties aside. With a deft movement, you guide his cock into your wet and ready pussy. \n\n&lt;img src=data/smug5.png&gt;\n\n&quot;Ooooooh, fuck,&quot; you moan as you bottom out on his cock. \n\nYour pussy feels so full as your muscles try to pull him deeper. You place your hands on the man’s shoulders and he grabs you around your hips as the two of you descend into frantic sex. \n\nThe audience erupts into a chorus of cheers, catcalls, and hoots as you ride the man like a woman possessed and scream out in pleasure. When you climax, your pussy clenches around the man’s pulsing cock like a vice as his cum coats your insides.

You need some help and decide it is time for some flattery.\n\n&quot;I really liked the way you handled yourself when driving. As we came out of the tunnels and into the van, it felt just like a robbery getaway from the old days,&quot; you say in an admirable tone to Tyrone. \n\n&quot;Well I didn't want to hang around there.

Didn’t wear anything suitable under this armour I'm afraid.&quot;\n\nThe laughter starts again as someone in the background asks if you’re even wearing anything under your armour. The smuggler’s all join in on a good laugh before their leader cuts in.\n\n&quot;Celeste, they like to flirt and joke around, especially after danger. If you tell them to shut up, I promise they won't say another word,&quot; he says sternly. To be fair, the rush of chemicals and hormones running through your body after combat missions leaves you the same way. \n\n&lt;img src=data/smug1.png&gt;\n\nYou notice a smuggler coming towards you with some clothes and consider having some fun before you leave.\n\n[[Strip off the armour in front of a room full of men|Smuggler 3B]]\n[[Keep to yourself and head out|Smugglers Complete A]]</div><div tiddler="Intel9D" tags="" created="201505112212" modifier="twee" twine-position="4630,3930">You want nothing to do with this. You are are not playing any mystery games. Without any further effort you turn round and let yourself out of the outer door.\n\nAs the door shuts behind you and the locks engage you walk warily out of the apartment block and onto the main street. After making certain no-one is following you, you head back to your apartment.\n\n[[Return to your apartment|Apartment][$Days = $Days + 0.25]] &lt;&lt;set $Int9 to &quot;Complete&quot;&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Intel9E" tags="" created="201505130623" modifier="twee" twine-position="4770,3930">You sit down in the armchair and ponder the message.\n\n&quot;Make the right choices.&quot;\n\nIs sitting down in the armchair the right choice? You haven't been sitting around often and the person probably hasn't seen much of that recently when they were 'watching' you. No the man, woman, or person has probably seen you doing something kinky or sexual somewhere. Hence, this room...\n\n[[Wait in the armchair|Intel9B2]]\n&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Intel9B&quot;)&gt;&gt; [[Put the blindfold on and wait in the chair|Intel9B1]] &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Intel9F" tags="" created="201505112217" modifier="twee" twine-position="4910,3930">The cuffs close around your ankles with a pleasingly solid &quot;clunk&quot; and you take as wide a stance as you can, conscious of how open it makes your crotch. The wrist cuffs have enough slack to let you put them on easily, with the same solid &quot;clunk&quot; sounds. Taking a deep breath, you reach out and grab the two release handles. There you freeze, holding onto them. \n\nThe thought of pulling them is at once terrifying and wonderful. You look down and close your eyes, then look at the floor, then back at the door. Still your hands hesitate on the handles. Imagining your contact, you pull them both just a tiny distance. Imagining someone else, you pull them a little further. The pins hold the weights and you could still let yourself out.\n\nYou consider chickening out just before imagining an audience in the armchairs, waiting, you pull further and feel the pins grate against the weights as they retract. Your arms tremble slightly. Then you imagine the room falling away to leaving you out on the street, surrounded by ruffians. With moisture flooding your crotch you pull the handles hard.\n\nThe weights drop and the cuffs tug at your arms. You could hold them and still free yourself but instead you raise your arms, savouring every centimetre as you are stretched out further and further. You let them go as far as they can, then give an experimental pull. As you anticipated, the pulleys are on ratchets and you're trapped here now. Suddenly your clit is far too sensitive and your pussy is filled with a tingling need and you have no way to satisfy it. You can't even move enough to rub against your own panties. All you can do is wait and hope your contact arrives soon.\n\nHe arrives ten minutes later.\n\nIn the doorway, he stops to admire you, wordlessly, for several more minutes before he greets you. &quot;That's very nice,&quot; he tells you, &quot;but you don't really get the full effect this way.&quot; You can't see him due to the bright light and he walks behind. As he gets closer he tells you &quot;If we are going to talk then you need to wear this and sit on the sofa.&quot; At the same time he places a blindfold onto your head and covers your eyes. He lifts and pins on the weights holding your ankles apart then releases the ratchets on their pulleys to you can stand while he does the same with your wrists.\n\n&quot;Another time, perhaps, you can try it out properly.&quot; He laments. As you step out of the machine, he then leads you by the wrist until you reach the sofa and you sit down.\n\n[[Try to determine your surroundings|Intel9F1]]</div><div tiddler="Intel9G" tags="Stat_38" created="201505152158" modifier="twee" twine-position="4210,4070">You strip off your clothes and put them out of sight underneath a chair. Walking to the middle of the room, you stand, naked, facing the door. Four quick checks confirm the cuffs latch closed and can be opened. There don't seem to be any nasty surprises like hidden needles in them, or if there are they're pressure-activated and well hidden. Placing your feet wide apart, you bend to close a cuff around one ankle. The &quot;clunk&quot; as it closes sends a pulse of arousal through you. Another pulse follows it as the opposite cuff closes on your other ankle. \n\nYou line up the cables neatly, making sure they won't snag, and stick your bum out invitingly for an imaginary tormentor behind you. You then take the wrist cuffs in your hands and stand up straight. The wrist cuffs are on long enough cables to let them meet in front of your face, so it's easy to get them on, arousing you further. You could just take them right back off again but the thought dampens your arousal slightly.\n\nThere is only one way to free your libido from the freedom holding it back and that's to restrain yourself. Grasping the two handles provided for just that purpose, you take a deep breath and pull hard. The cables on your wrists snap tight and you reflexively pull back. Your hands rise to shoulder height but there is still slack in the system. You let your breath out slowly and relax your arms, letting the weights pull you spread-eagled. The ratchets chatter as the pulleys turn and you quickly find you can't pull your hands back. There's no escape for you until your captor, having sated his lust, releases you. The thought wets your crotch and your face flushes with desire. The thought of having to wait sounds like torture.\n\nTo pass the time, you make a game of stretching, trying to get each ratchet in turn to click over just one more tooth and pull you that little bit more tightly each time. With each click it becomes harder and you have to use everything you've got to make the last restraint click one final time before you're happy. Barely able to move from the neck down, your breath slightly short with the strain across your chest as you watch the door and wait. You’re anxious to be taken, groped, photographed, spanked, whipped, fucked brutally hard, kissed even harder, to be punished for imaginary transgressions, to be surrounded by horny strangers with cameras and eager hands, to be hurt and used...\n\nOr just for the man to actually keep his appointment. You have no idea how late he is but he's definitely late by now and you're horny and frustrated. The thought that he may not be coming crosses your mind and you hope someone comes, and soon, because the amount of moisture you're losing down your thighs at all your thoughts of what could happen is going to make you awfully thirsty by morning.\n\nAfter an agonizing wait, you see light in the corridor outside the room. A shadow moves in from it and then your contact is in the doorway. He stands still, staring at you for a long moment, then shakes his head. Behind him, the interior door closes and the light is gone. \n\n&quot;Very disappointing,&quot; he says from the shadows.\n\nBeing addressed by someone you can barely see while he can clearly see every part of you, naked under the bright lights, is so sexy you barely register the words at first.\n\n&quot;I'd hoped for more. While I admire your willingness to get stuck straight into things, you're not demonstrating an ability to plan ahead, to make sure everything is in place.&quot; He says sounding disappointed.\n\nHe walks towards you slowly and stops within an arm's length. He could reach out now and touch, squeeze, or slap any part of you, and you could do nothing to evade him. You can't help groaning with need at the thought. Whatever he's about to do to you, you are looking forward to it immensely.\n\nWhat he does is reach down to the table beside the pillars, grab the blindfold laid out on it, hold it up in front of you and push it into your mouth. You take it and try to sensually suck his fingers, but he withdraws his hand. Moving round beside you, he lifts one of the weights up and pins it in place on the pillar, releasing the tension from your arm and legs on that side causing your excitement to immediately plummet.\n\n&quot;I'll think I'll about sending you details of another meeting place and time,&quot; he says. &quot;I hope you make a better second impression, but I may be able to find someone who is a little less......keen to please, without thinking.&quot; Showing you the ball gag and earmuffs he states &quot;Attention to detail, Celeste. Very important&quot;. With that, he leaves you.\n\nYou got no release at all and it felt like a waste of a trip. You hope he'll at least jerk off over the memory of your body suspended like that. You didn't even get any new work from this. You'll have to do better next time, indeed. \n\nAfter some twisting, you manage to get your teeth to the latch at your wrist and start freeing yourself. Now that you're not looking forward to being used and abused, the air in the room is uncomfortably cold on your skin and you dress quickly before leaving.\n\n[[Return to your apartment|Apartment][$Days = $Days + 0.25]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC38&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Mental = $Mental + 2&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $KS to 2&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Int9 to &quot;Complete&quot;&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Intel9A" tags="" created="201505112212" modifier="twee" twine-position="4210,3930">Two sturdy pillars connect floor and ceiling, almost too far apart for your arms to span the gap. They're clad in real wood to match the cabinet, the tables, and the frames of the armchairs, too. It is a nice touch. The pillars aren't solid, you see from the side. There are mechanisms within them.\n\nEach has two weights in vertical tracks, held up by pins and connected to cables. The cables run over pulleys at the tops of the pillars. From there one cable goes down within the pillar and under a pulley near the base and the other hangs down the inner face of the pillar. At about shoulder-height, there is a handle connected to each pillar. They seem to be attached to the pins. Each pulley also has a small lever beside it; possibly a ratchet release.\n\nAs you are examining them, you find yourself getting more and more turned on even though you've carefully avoided the remaining detail: the ends of the cables. With a rush of blood to your cheeks and your groin, you turn your attention to what you already know are there: four bulky cuffs. Each cable ends in a loop from which lighter cables connect it to eyes on opposite sides of one cuff so it won’t twist. \n\nThe cuffs latch closed and can be opened by pressing a button located on the side you won't be able to reach if you're wearing them. Of course, you could take one off by releasing it with the other hand, but if you were to put the ankle cuffs around your ankles and the wrist cuffs around your wrists and then pull those levers you'd be pulled into a spread-eagle posture by the weights and the ratchets would prevent you pulling your hands back together to undo the cuffs. You'd be helpless, waiting for your contact or anyone else to come and release you. That is, if they even intended to release you. Your thighs clench and rub together at the thought.\n\n[[Examine the table|Intel9B]]\n[[Get yourself a drink|Intel9C]]\n[[Sit in an armchair|Intel9E]]\n[[Strap yourself fully clothed into the apparatus|Intel9F]]\n[[Strap yourself naked into the apparatus|Intel9G]]\n&lt;&lt;if $Mot &gt;= 2&gt;&gt;After examining the table and the apparatus you realize you could also [[Strap yourself naked into the apparatus with the blindfold, ball gag and earmuffs on|Intel9H1]]\n[[Leave|Intel9D]]&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;[[Leave|Intel9D][$Mot = $Mot + 1&gt;]]&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Intel9B" tags="" created="201505112212" modifier="twee" twine-position="4350,3930">The table matches the side-tables by the armchairs.

The place is completely spartan and devoid of any human artefacts.\n\nWhile you are in the bedroom searching, you hear the armour closet door open and know you have seconds to react. That man was extremely quick in getting his armour off that you had anticipated. All you could think to do is start to undress in the hope that of you in your bra pulling your cleaners jumpsuit down will entice him enough.

In a room this small, without any weapon of your own, if you attack him you know he’ll be able to overpower you and it will only make things worse.

Glancing up at him and seeing his impatient gaze, you pull off your bra, then your panties, and are left nude before the man. \n\n&quot;On the bed.

There is nothing you can do but accept the fucking that is to come.

What the fuck is going on?\n\n&quot;Celeste you talking to me&quot; shouts Sid in your head, rudely breaking protocol for comms implant communications.\n\n&quot;Yes Sid I fucking am&quot; you scream back, &quot;I’m in a bit of a situation here. I will call you back&quot; and hang up on him. \n\nYou lunge at ‘M’ and start lashing out at him, quickly knocking him to the floor and then smashing his head into the floor until you are hit with a massive headache, you feel really high and then you blank out.\n\nWhen you wake up your implants tell you it was just for 15 seconds and all you have to show for it is a throbbing head pain. The reason is an emergency chemical stimulation, odd, but you can't figure it out at the moment. You glance at ‘M’, did he have another name? There is one at the back of your mind somewhere. ‘M’ is breathing though there is blood on the floor, you might have cracked his skull.  The problem is you can’t remember how this happened, your last memory was coming in to sort out the stockings, now you are naked apart from the stockings, which feel so good……..\n\nYou find one hand stroking the stockings and your other intimately touching yourself before you get yourself together.  Knowing that you need to get out of here you quickly pull the stockings off and get your underwear and jumpsuit back on. Resisting the temptation to murder ‘M’ you head out of the Fantasy Wear store. As you leave you wonder to yourself if you just tried to kill ‘M’ but your body would not agree. \n\n[[Get out of here|FW3.2D]]\n</div><div tiddler="MRE2C" tags="Stat_54" created="201507082037" modifier="twee" twine-position="710,5750">You strip naked and start to clean the room. Before ten minutes are up, the Drake comes out of the armour closet and looks at you surprised.\n\n&quot;You’re actually cleaning the room naked?&quot; he asks amused. &quot;You know what, I think this is the first time that any girl has done that. You sure you are not actually a hooker sent up to give me a good time?&quot;\n\nYou glance over and give a knowing smile; it is best he thinks this and let his guard down. Drake grins and licks his lips as he admires your naked form. \n\n&quot;Great! I will have to thank the men after I've fucked you good. Maybe I could send you down to the barracks afterwards. Think your pussy can handle fifty men in one night?&quot; he asks as he chuckles to himself.\n\nAgain you smile and wonder how this subject keeps coming up or why you like the idea more each time. You refocus and realize that you have an Evictor mercenary who is still standing in front of you while holding his throbbing cock.\n\n&quot;Wait here,&quot; he says as he walks into the bedroom and then returns with a combat knife. &quot;Now you’ll know I’m serious when I tell you to fuck me like your life depends on it.&quot; He grins evilly then sits back in a chair and tells you to get your pussy ready and then ride him facing away.\n\nYou stand there perplexed, but he points toward your pussy with his knife and you take the hint to start rubbing yourself. One hand plays with your nipples, tweaking them, as you try to think of anything sexy. You start picturing yourself with the fifty Evictors, worked up and waiting for you downstairs; anything but the knife in front of you. Your body responds quickly and you feel two fingers slide into your wet pussy. The Sub-Commander smiles as he gestures you over and you sit on his cock like he asked.\n\nYou take him to the hilt and start to bounce and rock on his shaft. With one hand, the man alternates between rubbing just above your clit and groping your left breast. His right hand holds his knife and he regularly presses it against you, occasionally leaving superficial cuts on you. It is clear he is enjoying terrorizing you and talks about cutting your breasts open, slitting your throat, or just slicing you up when he climaxes. \n\nTo his surprise though none of that happens, you take an opportunity on a downward bounce to force the knife down and deep into his right thigh. You feel the knife stick as it plunges into bone. As his left arm comes round to throttle you, you bounce forwards, breaking his erect penis with a horrible popping sound as you come down on his legs.  You jump up and the man rolls forward and onto the ground as he screams in agony. \n\nThe man is trying to get up on his wounded leg, putting pressure on the wound, as he advances towards you. The fight however ends quickly with you jabbing and kicking the injured leg until he falls over. He tries to get up again and you repeat the combination until you manage to pull the knife from him wound. The Sub-Commander no longer attempts to get up, his wounds finally proving too much for him. The man will die within minutes from blood loss and it is up to you whether he passes quickly or not.\n\n[[Leave him to suffer|MRE2C1]]\n[[Give him a quick death|MRE2C2]]\n[[Torture him in his final moments|MRE2C3]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC54&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;&lt;set $Training = $Training + 2&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="MRE2B" tags="" created="201507082037" modifier="twee" twine-position="570,5750">Even if you find a weapon, you’ll still have to fight the man and if he thinks you are being compliant it may be easier to catch him off guard. On this basis, you rush to the bedroom and strip off your clothes and throw them beside the bed. You start to frantically search the apartment for something to fight the man with and to your growing horror realize the apartment is spartan in decoration. The man keeps no trophies or anything else that could be used to your advantage. While you are searching the bathroom, you hear the armour closet door opening. \n\n&quot;Damn, that man was quick,&quot; you mutter to yourself. He took only half the time you had expected.\n\n&quot;You aren’t trying to hide from me now, are you?&quot; calls out his voice in a light playful tone. You rush out of the bathroom door into the lobby, your breasts jiggling as you run.\n\n&quot;Just cleaning the bathroom, sir.&quot; You call back. The man smiles when he sees your naked form and you glance at his heavily muscled frame and slowly hardening cock. You weigh your options to fight back but realize that you would not win. \n\n&quot;I am pleased you’re being so compliant, bitch. Now get on your knees and crawl to the bedroom,&quot; gloats the man. You pause for a second and reconsider fighting back in spite of the odds.\n\n&quot;Don't try my patience,&quot; he states, starting to get frustrated. &quot;You have done well so far. Some bitches would be crying by now and I admire your resilience, but this is your last warning. Now, ''go''&quot; shouts Drake.\n\nIt is clear that he won’t hesitate to attack you, so with great reluctance you follow the instructions, get on your hands and knees, and crawl towards the bedroom.  As you get to the bed, the humiliation of the act flustering your mind, you are told to climb up and press your face into the pillow.\n\nYou adopt the pose and wait there from ten long seconds, naked, your ass up in the air in front of a psychopath. You feel humiliated, vulnerable, and slightly aroused as you wait on all fours, elbows touching the mattress, knowing that you are about to receive a rough fucking in either or both of your holes. The man climbs up onto the bed and parts your lower lips with his fingers and finds them wet.\n&quot;You know what, you seem to get off on being a dirty girl, so I think your whore ass needs a thorough pounding.&quot; You let out a groan at his degrading remarks and he laughs. \n\n&quot;Time to spread those cheeks, bitch!&quot; he excitedly orders you.\n\n[[Pull your cheeks apart|MRE3]]</div><div tiddler="FW3.2D" tags="" created="201612312032" modifier="twee" twine-position="3370,850">It is only when you get back to your apartment that you remember that Sid called you, you call him back and are relieved to hear that he had a resourcing problem and wanted to find out if you could be off planet next week. You can’t really remember the conversation you had with Sid and when he asks you what you are doing now, and what you were doing before you make some shit up. Not wanting to tell Sid that you were naked in some shop, out of your mind. \n\nWhile Sid’s reason is a bit lame, Sid is far more organised than that, you are focussed on yourself, what the hell happened there and why do you get a feeling of joy over the stockings?\n\nYour head is still hurting and you decide that you need some serious rest.\n\n[[Meanwhile|FW3.2E]]\n</div><div tiddler="Intel21.1" tags="" created="201605292039" modifier="twee" twine-position="4910,5890">When you go to meet with Jane to discuss the results you feel a little bit apprehensive. Is this you seeing things that are none there? The mind is a funny thing and you’re sure being strapped into that device will have some lingering psychological effects, at least in the short-term. Jane seemed to take it seriously so there must be something on her mind to make her worry that much. She knows you very well; the benefit of a platonic military relationship where secrets are few.\n\nWhen you speak to Jane the answers are inconclusive and really provide more questions than answers. The bottom line is that your implants are more active than is normal, which consists of during combat situations and when you are exerting your body in physical exercise. To help the computer analyze the data you needed to provide a cross reference of what you were doing at the time, which was taken care of by Jane since she has been keeping a diary of your adventures, much to your annoyance. \n\nThe new analysis is conclusive of the fact that that the implants have been clearly activating during sexual encounters. Now neither of you could say this was totally wrong as some of them were stressful encounters and the implants could have assisted what was thought to be a stressed, physical response. So if the implants were only injecting some relief chemicals into your system, why did the loss of them make you feel ‘odd’ after the electric shock?\n\nThe other factor was the number of electro-mechanical signals the implants were relaying. The Magnum’s computer struggled with these as it could not create a neural map of the human body and analyze the signals further. You would need a powerful computer to do that and the Magnum’s system was built mainly for system penetration, not replicating and studying an entire neural system in a short time frame.\n\nThe problem is you are in a life and death struggle here and you can’t afford to get distracted by something that could be nothing. If the opportunity presents itself on planet, you will reconstruct the analysis routine on a super computer and see what it determines. You will also consider speaking to Maddock, though you doubt he has the necessary computer resources available but may be able to catch something in the data from the analysis Jane and you managed to miss.\n\n[[Return to your apartment|Apartment]] &lt;&lt;set $Int21 to &quot;Complete&quot;&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;set $CamTrigger to 1&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;set $ImplantInv to 1&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Days to $Days + 1&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="CL3.3" tags="" created="201611122121" modifier="twee" twine-position="3090,6730">Forgotten about you lie there until the stern looking Asian lady comes to get the girls.

All the girls are lined up and put in order of surviving, when you are placed at the top of the line you know you have won. All the other girls are covered in goo. There are a few men around and from you can understand is that some girls are being individually booked for other 1 on 1 sessions. \n\nYou feel slightly worried at that as you are highly visible at the front of the line, and they might realise that you have no agent to take the booking. Before it gets to that point though the Dragon Gang leader comes down to pay his respects to the agents who supplied the girls for his party.  When he gets to you he congratulates you on being the most disciplined whore, and asks how your agent, your master has made you so obedient. You tell him that you are your own agent.\n\nThis angers or amuses him, you cannot tell but he looks quizzically at the Asian women, who looks embarrassed and confused.  The Dragon Gang leader tells you that you will be serving his leadership team sake at the after party. The Asian women looks daggers at you and escorts you to the upstairs room, on route she tells you that she has a lot of questions for you when you finish. \n\nYou only spend 10 minutes serving Sake when a agitated man comes in disturbing the leadership and asking for a quiet word with the leader. The conversation is short and sweet and the Dragon Gang leader accuses you of being a spy.  You throw the contents of a glass of Sake at him and tell him you’re not. As the liquid drips of his face the room is silent, you have committed a grave insult and an attendant brings the Gang Leaders katana to him. \n\nThe Gang Leader tells you in a calm way that he is now going to kill you, it will be slow he promises, you will beg for him to end it. Knowing that they are an honour bound you demand a trial by combat, when he shakes his head you tell him you think he is scared of a whore. This and the alcohol enrages him and he agrees saying that you have probably gained a quicker end.

Your implants are fired up for full active mode and in you go, prepped for a stressful infiltration mission, all for a 5 minute elevator ride!\n\nWhen you climb in you feel a good fit for the nervous first timers, they are scared of the glass floor and heights, while you are scared of losing control of yourself. As the elevator starts to move you keep your concentration up, scanning everything, taking all details and then nothing………..\n\nWhen you come around the first thing you feel is a wetness between your thighs and a slowly fading heat and feeling of bliss. You have orgasmed, you must have, but you can’t remember it. You look at yourself, you are fully dressed in your jumpsuit and as you look at the elevator occupants, all eyes are on you with a mixture of disgust, anger and shock.\n\nWhen the exit doors open, the people walk out and you hear a collection of comments such as ‘did she orgasm’, ‘was it a stunt’, ‘that bitch ruined the ride’ and ‘dirty harlot’. You walk out looking shamefaced and confused. Do you have control over yourself? What is going on? You walk over to quiet corner of the elevator lobby and stand around dazed and confused for around 10 minutes. Your reverie is interrupted by two Space Quarter security staff who invite you to an interview room, you follow as you have little choice, they can find out your visa identity easily enough. \n\nWhen you get to the interview room you are shown video footage of your antics on the Space Elevator, you watch with horror as you lean into a corner of the elevator spread your legs and place your hand right on top of your covered pussy. The hand movements, groaning and moaning coming to a crescendo make it a clear noisy performance, then after orgasmic bliss your face take a confused, dazed and down beaten form and shuffle off the elevator. The questions then come in thick and fast:\n\n“Was this a prank, are you acting up?”\n\n“Are you on hallucinogenic or other substance considered dangerous?”\n\n“Do you get sexual thrills for public stunts such as this?”\n\n“Are you mentally deranged, or have some other issue with psychosis?”\n\nThe questions bring you back to reality with a bump and you don’t want to end up having a medical assessment of your mental well-being, too much information might come out. You say you were dared to it and took a stim high, which meant you were out of it. You apologise profusely, say you were so stupid and use all the feminine charm you can muster in the situation. \n\nEventually they relent, but castigate you for being a little too old for these kind of stunts, if they find out that you are doing this for publicity or monetary gain there will be a heavy fine. As it is you are banned from the Space Elevator and you can take the stairs down today, they find that amusing, it will take a long time and they consider it punishment enough.\n\nWhen you leave the office you head to the stairwell, the exercise and the monotony is good thinking time for you to brood on what happened, are you going nuts, why do you keep thinking about being punished. When you get off this planet are you going to need a full mental check-up? Before you get to the stairwell you encounter the woman you made out with on the elevator, she recognises and you react with shock, saying that you are really sorry. The woman tells you that people like you should hand out at this ‘place’, and hands you a card, she then brushes past you and walks off, leaving you stunned.\n\nYou look at the card and it is for an address in the Red Light District, the card gives no clue to what the place is. No doubt an insult but what gets you is the timing, the Space Quarter is big and you are in a quiet part of it. Did the security people tip her off? Or have you been followed? The whole thing is getting stranger and stranger. The address of this ‘place’ is just off the central boulevard.\n\n\n[[Return to Apartment|Apartment]]\n&lt;&lt;set $GE to 4&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Days to $Days + 1&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $NaughtyGirl to 2&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="AL2.5" tags="" created="201803191745" modifier="twee" twine-position="2390,3230">The man is spent, energy all gone from all the fucking.

As it currently stands there is an informal truce in place, but Sid is pushing the boundaries, they actually thought you were sent by Sid to spy on them, not fully understanding the freelance aspect.  They then apologise and say that they captured Jane while you were in the hotel to corroborate stories, this causes you to noticeably tense up, they calm you down saying Jane is safe and well but you need hear them out.\n\nYou lean back in the sofa and let yourself relax, at least Jane will be able to corroborate the freelance story.\n\n“Do you know Jane took a backhander from Sid to get you to leave the military, a big backhander as it became clear you would not work directly for Sid, would only go freelance?”\n\n“No”, you reply, a little hurt that Jane did not tell you. \n\n“Jane had to leave the military as well, frustrating Sid’s chances to recruit more people, though the military would have probably identified Jane as the source of the poaching attempts, Sid has tried many times to get Jane to convince you to join him directly” she tells you.\n\nThis irritates you again, Jane has not mentioned it, according to her Sid never talks to her, Sid only cares about his asset, you. \n\nThe man now speaks; “Why did Jane not wear her helmet on that fateful mission, standard military SOP’s are to where the helmet, she is used to flying with it, why not?”\n\n“It doesn’t really matter” you reply, “Jane told me it was due to the emergency extraction, and the helmet was not in the cockpit, you could easily alter her memories, so it is a moot point” you finish off, not sure if they had a point or were trying to sow doubt in your mind. \n\n“You don’t trust us, we understand but we extracted a good bit of evidence of Sid’s operations from Jane’s memory, some buried quite deep, don’t worry she is fine, no damage, we can just pull out inconsequential memories like snapshots of locations, we have a good dossier to give you to find Sid”.\n\nYou tell them that any information is good, you don’t know a lot about Sid, understandably if you get captured. They offer one more thing, they tell you that your experiences on Evindium have changed you, considerably, you don’t say much to that, just nod.  They then add that Jane was starting to argue about your partying antics, you nod again, it was true.  The crunch is that they would be happy to condition into Jane absolute loyalty to you, and up for more, a good partying companion.\n\nYou take this on board, times have changed, you have changed and should Jane change?

You choke on your drink with the laughter.\n\nAs the waitress heads off, routine all finished, you keep glancing over at the podium dancers. Maybe you would like to do it? Flash your flesh to the audience? Nah, they are just cheap sluts, that is not you? But hey it looks fun…..  Duncan notices that you are distracted and the combination of alcohol, naked gyrating girls and you sat very close to him as ensured his hand lands on your knee, pauses and then works its way up the inside of your thigh. \n\nYou glance over at Duncan and he smiles and then whispers quietly; &quot;I know you want to be up on that podium, I know it&quot;, with that said his hand slips between your legs and fondles your pussy through the jumpsuit and then whispers again &quot;Wish you were wearing a dress………&quot;.  \n\nWith the sensations and thoughts going through your mind, you are in agreement.

The hours tick on by as the conversation shifts to a flirtier and sometimes sexual tone. It is clear the man likes you; his hand has brushed your knee a few times and he keeps slowly moving in closer.\n\nHis name is Duncan and he is a shuttle pilot who actually recognized you from the Space Quarter. He said the unique colour of your jumpsuit and large tits made you catch his eye in the crowd. You get a chuckle from the overly forward remark about your breasts and are sure he is drunk. You tease him that he is probably just looking to add another notch on his bedpost which makes his burst out in a booming laugh.\n\nDuncan makes a guess that you were ex-military, and you admit it, telling him you would have to kill him if he asked anymore questions.  While you are both laughing at the remark one of the waitresses approaches you, in her leotard and cat ears.  You watch with interest as she sways closer and leans forward showing off her tits for Duncan’s, or your benefit? You really can’t tell, but she must think you are a couple?  Or soon to be?\n\nDuncan catches your eye, orders some more drinks, tips the waitress and asks her to do a little dance on the table.

Welcome to the Evindium Weapons Emporium, the premier independent personal defence weapon and safety equipment provider on the planet.&quot;\n\nThe salesperson is obviously trying to get a read on you and gives you his best smile before continuing.\n\n&quot;How can we be of service to you this fine afternoon, madam? If I may be so bold, madam seems to have the air of someone who knows what they desire and is someone who can appreciate items of finer quality and craftsmanship.&quot;\n\nThe salesperson pauses waiting for you to fill in the blanks.\n\nYou give the man a short smile before responding. &quot;Well,&quot; you say, &quot;What I’m interested in are the personal combat systems and equipment you have in stock or I can get within couple of weeks.  I am also interested in anything that doesn’t require a special permit to be taken out of the Space Quarter limits.&quot;\n\n&quot;I assume the madam wishes to merely ensure her personal safety outside Space Quarter as the planetary authorities strongly dislike high tech weapons outside their control?&quot; he inquires. You give the man a nod\n\n&quot;To do this, madam, one would require a standard personal protection weapon license which only allows madam to carry non-firearm weapons,&quot; he says in response. You are slightly disappointed but not very surprised by this.\n\n&quot;If madam would provide me with her contact information, I will send her the required forms and regulations for applying for the license,&quot; he says sounding pleased. You quickly enter your contact details on the salesperson’s datapad.\n\n&quot;Right. Now could I see what you have in stock on the personal weapon side?&quot; you ask.\n\nThe salesperson smiles again and says, &quot;Certainly, madam. I shall prepare booth number five for you. If you would be so kind as to follow this way.&quot;\n\nHe leads you to a small circular room with number of luxurious reclining chairs. You take a seat in one of the chairs and soon the lights dim and a pleasant pre-recorded female voice walks you through the various options while virtual representations of the weapons are displayed.\n\nAfter spending about half an hour going through the catalogue you get up and leave the shop knowing that there were some good weapons available.

The show is going to be focused on four events:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;&lt;popup &quot;Desert Chase&quot; &quot;RTGA&quot;&gt;&gt; – From what you can tell, a hunter named Death Bladez will be given a jetbike to hunt contestants trekking across a desert towards a safe point.&lt;/li&gt;\n\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;&lt;popup &quot;Tunnel Run&quot; &quot;RTGB&quot;&gt;&gt; – An underground tunnel complex where a pistol wielding woman going by Shadow Viper will attempt to stalk and gun down a few more contestants.&lt;/li&gt;\t\n\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;&lt;popup &quot;Sniper Shuffle&quot; &quot;RTGC&quot;&gt;&gt; – Navigate an urban environment while hunted by a sniper going by the Crimson Talon from the skyscrapers above. This is made worse by there being a number of choke points that all of the contestants will have to pass through.&lt;/li&gt;\n\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;&lt;popup &quot;Tower Ascension&quot; &quot;RTGD&quot;&gt;&gt; – A solo event for any remaining contestants. They will have to reach to the top of a building while being stalked by an expertly equipped ninja dubbed the Masked Mamba. It is extremely rare for more than one contestant to make it to this stage, much less anyone actually finish it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\nYou have carried out some prep wok by infiltrating some of the testing grounds. In the desert you have buried a number of EMP mines so if this Death Bladez does find you, their bike will be crash shortly after. So long as the bike catches fire there will be no evidence without a lengthy forensics investigation.  A proximity sensor has been stashed in the tunnels along with some climbing hooks, both easily discarded in the drains after they’re used. In order to deal with the sniper, you have hacked the entry system where her nest will be located. You can now sneak in and pay her a visit without any record of you doing so. The ascension should actually be the easiest since you’ve already met the &quot;ninja&quot; named Mark. The proximity bug you left in his ass is going to lead to him getting a nasty surprise when he thinks he’s corned you. \n\nYou can’t seem to agree on a strategy with Jane and are torn on whether you should take out all four hunters or try to avoid them as much as possible. If the public is rooting for you, then it is likely that the show’s producers will not help the hunters find you. Charles was empathetic on that point, so you’re sure that the hunters get very little help from the show. The exception has been made for certain contestants if their death or suffering will give an instant boost to ratings; everything in the name of show business. If you piss off the show’s executives, then they will arrange your death and you just know Charles is going to be up for that if he recognizes you. Your best safety net will be to make the ratings go wild and earn favour, allowing you to win the jackpot to the chagrin of the management; they don’t want to risk the bad publicity. \n\nJoining the show is easy and you ace the health and physical exams without revealing your true potential. The health check had you slightly worried when a number of scanners came out but they were only interested in contagious deceases. When you were given the all clear, the nurse explained that a good number of applicants have fatal deceases and are willing to put their life on the line since they have nothing to lose; an earlier, quicker death may even be its own prize. Once accepted on to the show, you are given a reporting date as all the events are recorded consecutively over a twenty-four-hour period. In the meantime, accommodations are provided to you while you are given a room at a luxury resort. \n\nYou spend the time in your room and the gym, allowing yourself the luxury of one massage before the event begins. Your time in the room is spent memorising the layouts of the desert and tunnel stages until you know the area like the back of your hand and planning for the second half. Eventually you are summoned and a pair of plain sportswear and jumpsuit is supplied to you. After you change, you are lead aboard an aircraft which will take you off into the desert.\n\n[[Continue with your mental preparations on the flight|RTG1.1]]</div><div tiddler="AL3.7" tags="" created="201803191912" modifier="twee" twine-position="3790,3230">Agent Lucy had carried over the battery pack and attached the nipple clamps, all that was left was to attach the wires to the clamps.\n\nAgent Lucy had found Purple Ninja's mobile phone, called in the cavalry and just needed to kill some time.

Did you make a decision, or did you just jump on board?\n\nAs you look round the elevator there are three occupants all holding onto the side rails, all looking nervously at the glass bottom. The elevator is currently at ground level and you wonder how they will feel halfway up, this ride is the slow tourist version to take in the view.  Having said that it will only take a few minutes and you will be off.\n\nAs the elevator starts you start to feel a strong impulse, a compulsion, a desire to snog a woman opposite. Then it all goes blank……\n\nWhen you come around you are tightly embracing a shocked woman, one hand is around the back of her head, and the other on her posterior. One of her arms is trapped and the other weakly pushing you away, shock lending it lifelessness. A lovers embrace and you can taste her lipstick, the elevator has reached its destination and you rapidly pull away, glancing round at the confused expressions of the elevator occupants. \n\nThe woman looks at you and speaks “Why, why would you do that, kiss me in front of all these PEOPLE!”\n\nWhen you don’t reply, she storms out of the elevator and a couple approach you;\n\n“Was that a prank? You looked so composed and we thought she was going to be sick, she was shaking so much and then you jumped her and were making out big time, looked like she responded back?” says the woman\n\n“Look forward to the programme” adds the man before walking out. \n\nYou head out of the elevator and sit down. What the hell happened, you blanked out and find yourself looked in an embrace which you started, you basically are molesting strangers! Guilt and worry kick in, what the hell is going on, are you going crazy, losing control of yourself? A tear starts to form in your eye, why are you being punished here, why are you losing your mind. You get yourself together and head back out into the Space Quarter. \n\n[[Return to your apartment|Apartment]]\n&lt;&lt;set $GE to 3&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="GE1" tags="" created="201506292012" modifier="twee" twine-position="570,1550">As someone who has been out in space, scaled the outsides of tall buildings, and made several HALO (High Altitude - Low Opening) parachute insertions behind enemy lines, the glass floor of the observation elevator does not bother you one little bit.  But you had to give it a go, the trip will give you a good view of Evindium, and will only take 30 minutes of your time. \n\nYou know the score; the elevator will rise slowly from the base of the space elevator and at the start will play videos of Evindium over the last 50 years. During that time, it will have slowly risen and the videos will turn off, and the floor will go transparent. Some people will panic, and you slightly look forward to this as some of the occupants of the elevator started to get anxious after the first fifty meters.  A large display showing the height gained is attached to four sides of a central pillar in the elevator.\n\nAt two-hundred meters some people are shaking and wanting to get off. At four-hundred meters, with one of the windows open and the wind whistling through, most are huddled on the side closest to the door and space elevator complex and looking upwards. You find yourself on the outside edge, next to a man with a death grip on a support rail. The man looks at you and speaks;\n\n&quot;Don’t mind me, I’m just trying to keep things together, to stop me from panicking, I’m trying to think of something else&quot; he tells you, a slight edge to his voice.  \n\n&quot;Think of sex&quot; you tell him quietly, amused by him and some of the chuckles nearby. The man does not reply and you think no more of it.\n\nNext thing you know, the man, on your left is leaning towards you. You don’t have any space on your right to move in to, so you hold your ground. After all, it is only his shoulder, then his right arm, snakes around your waist, and then locks itself on the rail, resuming a white knuckled death grip on it. The upshot is unless you remove the arm, you are held onto the rail. You glance over at the man, and he looks scared. What do you do?\n\n[[Ask the man to remove his arm|GE1.1]]\n[[Ignore it, it is no problem mummy’s boy holding onto you|GE1.2]]\n</div><div tiddler="GameEnding3" tags="" created="201707121639" modifier="twee" twine-position="10,7710">&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th colspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Game Ending 2&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt; \n&lt;/thead&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;&lt;if $Training &lt;= 50&gt;&gt; &lt;img src=data/ge1.png&gt;\n&lt;&lt;elseif $Training &lt; 65 and $Training &gt;= 50&gt;&gt;&lt;img src=data/ge2.png&gt;\n&lt;&lt;elseif $Training &lt; 80 and $Training &gt;= 65&gt;&gt;&lt;img src=data/ge3.png&gt;\n&lt;&lt;elseif $Training &lt;= 100 and $Training &gt;= 80&gt;&gt; &lt;img src=data/ge4.png&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Sid...  &lt;/h1&gt;Back in safe space the Magnum is docked at a nearby Space Port and the crew discuss the next steps.....&lt;/center&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;&lt;if $SidTrust &lt; 2&gt;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;&lt;timedinsert 4s&gt;&gt;Things have to change, events on Evindium have shown that putting too much trust in Sid is a bad thing.\n&lt;&lt;becomes&gt;&gt;What is clear is if these infiltration missions go wrong, you are on your own.\n&lt;&lt;becomes&gt;&gt;Trust in Sid has been broken and while there is agreement that it is still a good idea to take some missions from Sid's organisation,\n&lt;&lt;becomes&gt;&gt;Fully depending on him is a bad idea.\n&lt;&lt;becomes&gt;&gt;The plan is to see what you can do, collectively as a team.\n&lt;&lt;becomes&gt;&gt;[[Next|GameEnding4]] &lt;&lt;endtimedinsert&gt;&gt; &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; \n\n&lt;&lt;set $EndGoal to 1&gt;&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;&lt;timedinsert 4s&gt;&gt;Things have to change, events on Evindium have shown that putting too much trust in Sid is a bad thing.\n&lt;&lt;becomes&gt;&gt;You still struggle with the concept that Sid has been playing you for such a long time.\n&lt;&lt;becomes&gt;&gt;To think he was training you the whole time... \n&lt;&lt;becomes&gt;&gt;It would seem some of this training is still affecting you.\n&lt;&lt;becomes&gt;&gt;Revenge is now what you desire.\n&lt;&lt;becomes&gt;&gt;Sid, whoever he really is, will be a dead man.

But in return you will rig up a private Shebo show for all of the group. You will just have to check out the gear in the bedrooms and head off to have a look round, pretending to stagger on the way.  When you get into one of the bedrooms you discuss options with Lina, you know that you have to get Paul on his own. Paul will only push his luck if there are no witnesses. That means that either you or Lina will have to keep the attention of the other men, as Paul is clearly more infatuated with you than Lina, then Lina is going to have to entertain the men. \n\nWhile you prep, Lina is going to drop a hint to Paul that if he wants your pussy, then you will be waiting for him in one of the side rooms after the blokes are distracted by herself. When Lina comes back with all the men she gives a you a quick wink, signalling that Paul has taken the bait. You then move onto the next stage of the plan, tying a now naked Lina up in an elaborate Shibari rope demo. You make it a slow effort, caressing Lina as you wrap the rope around her body. When complete Lina is immobilised, in a rope setup that with a bit of effort she can release herself from. The next part is the distraction, Lina has been tied in a position exposing her pussy, putting her in a prime position for a good fucking, and you offer her up. Testing her pussy with your fingers you tell the men she is all there’s. You then say you need to set the next demo up and head off to the room, you then wait, slightly worried. \n\nYour worries are allayed when Paul arrives and apologies for the delay, he had to get his dick back under control after watching Lina. Looking at him his dick is fully erect and you start to fondle it, from outside his pants. As Paul starts to quickly undress saying he has to be quick you know that the only successful outcome here is for Paul to be caught in the act, with you. You let events take their natural course and you are soon being fucked missionary style. Using your comms implant and the internal room network you leave an anonymous message for Helen’s parents, telling them to come to this room for a surprise. As you send the message you let out a little laugh which set’s Paul off, telling you to change position and get onto all fours so he can pummel you. As he slides out of you, you decide to put yourself facing the door, so you can see Helen’s parents faces and revel in the occasion. Your time in Evindium has made shame a distant worry, Paul quickly gets himself in position and starts roughly fucking you, then the door opens and Helen’s parents walk in, there unsure faces quickly turn into shock, disgust and then outrage. \n\nAs Paul pulls out of you and starts stammering, you grab your gear and scuttle out of the room. As you are leaving you spot Helen making a beeline and Helen’s mother screaming at Paul. You quickly leave the party, and join a forewarned Lina. You sent her a message to be ready just prior to Paul fucking you.

There is a cheap security camera watching the corridor and a big sign saying ‘Nasty Sluts Only’.\n\nYou can guess why the woman gave you the address, it has got to be an insult but still as you are here you decide to open one of the doors and find a really decrepit toilet, the wall behind and to the sides as a number of holes in it and you think you have just found an external toilet block for one of the nearby small bars and clubs. A set of shared and disgusting toilets for the cheaper clubs, those that don’t want the customers in for long, or space is at a premium. You are about to leave when you feel a really strong desire to pee, really strong like you are about to wet yourself. You get yourself into one of the cubicles and relieve yourself, but as you are doing so a cock appears through one of the holes. You realise what you have walked to and that the camera was for the customers benefit and the world just fades away……\n\n\nThe next second it seems that you have a cock in your mouth and you struggle to work out what has happened, just a second ago you were about to have a pee, and then this has happened….\n\nAs you pull your mouth off the cock an annoyed and then pleading voice begs you to carry on, to finish off the tenth cock.\n\n&quot;Come on babe, do the ten, finish the challenge&quot; shouts an encouraging voice, behind the wall\n\nHave you just sucked off 9 cocks?

You are told, and you think quite genuinely that you are welcome to just train at the gym. Basically, fighters of your skill will help the up and coming, though it is disappointing that you are not taking any other matches. So, what are you going to do? If you take the match there is a very good chance that you will lose, but you might win again? If you spar, well it will work on your stress.

After you have finished off with the wardrobes you bounce around the room, bending over to clean the drawers, once those are done you move onto the finale, crawling round the room on your knees.  You start by the old man and crawl away, if he stays where he is you will work round the room and return to his position.  As you go around you loosen the straps on your outfit so the top is not so close to your tits, that will give him a view you think to yourself.\n\nStraight to plan the old man stays where he is, but his eyes follow you the entire way.  You carry on playing the game and crawl as seductively as you can.  When you are halfway around the room you are turned on big time by the activity.  As you finish off you remain on your hands and knees and look the man in the eye;\n\n“Has the maid completed the task to your satisfaction” you purr, then kick yourself as you realise you should have waited for him to speak.\n\n“Yes, very, very good job, you will be commended for your enthusiasm, if only I was a little younger” he chortles.\n\nYou get to your feet, curtsey and head out of the room.  Well that seemed easy, and he didn’t even grope you.  You head off back to the waiting room.\n\n[[Back to the waiting room|NG1.9]]\n\n&lt;&lt;set $MaidPoints +=1&gt;&gt;\n</div><div tiddler="Mission 9 Debrief" tags="" created="201510240855" modifier="twee" twine-position="290,6590">__Mission Debrief__\nYou done it, you captured one target and eliminated the other at great personal risk to you.

You are pulled and pushed out of the room and into a side room where you are told to wait.   The room is small and bare, the only contents are a selection of canes, crops and paddles and a severe looking bench, polished, but scratched on the edges. \n\nA closer look at the scratches confirms what you guessed, the scratches are from finger nails from when Maid’s are spanked over the bench.  Before coming to Evindium you would have freaked at being spanked for silly rules like this, the maid mistress and the hotel guest would have been a world of pain, but now?  You are not bothered in the least, you have suffered a lot worse and as BDSM games go, this is quite trivial, indeed you are getting a little hot under the collar.\n\nYour thoughts are interrupted by the woman you saw earlier and the maid mistress.\n\n“Girl” booms the maid mistress I’m told you were &lt;&lt;if $NG17 is 1&gt;&gt;late in returning the laundry, so you are to be spanked for your tardiness” she tells you.  \n&lt;&lt;elseif $NG17 is 2&gt;&gt;breaking house rules, by being found in a guests bedroom without permission, so you are to be spanked for breaking house rules” she tells you. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\n\nYou just meekly nod, playing the game and waiting for instructions. &lt;&lt;if $MaidOutfit is 1&gt;&gt;You are told to bend over the bench and the maid mistress lifts up the skirt of your slutty maid outfit, and reveals your bare ass and shaved pussy to the guest. &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You are told to hitch up your dress, hold it up and then bend over the bench.  You keep your gaze downward and meek looking as you gather up your dress, revealing your thong to all in the room. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\n\nYou lie across the bench and wait, watching and listening as the maid mistress talks about all the crop’s, canes and paddles in the room to the hotel guest.  Eventually a paddle is chosen and your spanking comes your way.\n\nHow do you play it?\n\n[[Meek &amp; Quiet|NG1.8A1]]\n[[Pretend it hurts, and make a scene|NG1.8A2]]\n</div><div tiddler="GE1.6A" tags="Stat_100" created="201804232105" modifier="twee" twine-position="1690,1550">“No you got that wrong”, you stutter, “I didn’t get off on you being totally fucked up” you finish off, slightly more forceful.\n\nThe man is has now moved behind you and grabbed your hips, his hands are travelling upwards over your ribs and you take in a deep breath as the hands envelop your tits and start fondling them. You look down at the shopping arcade below, and wonder if anyone will look up, your hands grip the railings tightly, reminding you of how the man was in the lift.\n\n“You sure you don’t like it, do you think anyone is watching?” he says seductively, sounding confident.\n\nYou don’t reply as the hands work there way down your body, your breath coming out slowly, hands still gripping the railings feeling your body betraying you, surrendering to the pleasure engulfing you. The hands go over your hips and the fingers slide over your inner thighs, just below your pussy.  You can feel his erection on your ass cheeks, and you know in a second, he will touch your pussy.  When it happens, you let out a short sigh, the sensation is great, even with two layers of clothing separating skin from skin.\n\n“Do you think the security guards are watching this on the camera’s, wondering if they will have to come along and arrest you for public indecency, you would like the search, the strip search” he leers to you, pushing his pelvis into you. \n\nYour legs spread wider, to give him more access, lost in feelings of lust, until you feel him step back and away.\n\n“Fuck”, he says. \n\nThe feeling of lust ebbs away as you see two security guards and a angry looking woman approaching. The man runs for it, with the guards in pursuit.  The woman heads over and speaks, sounding concerned;\n\n“I recognised that dirty pervert, he touched me up on the Space Elevator, and when I saw him doing those things to you, you must have been so scared” she continues, putting a hand on your shoulder.\n\nYou pull yourself together, and thank her, genuinely embarrassed that she thinks she saved you from him.

You wonder if he just likes seeing a subservient woman, on her hands and knees cleaning the room.  When you finish you get the gambit;\n\n“Maid, I need you to service me with your mouth” the man says, still sat in his chair, his erection visible underneath his pants.\n\nDecision time, you have cleaned the room and as far as you understand the rules, you can go.  But you know that the ‘M’s promised you freedom if you got a good score, whether they mean it is another matter.  Either way it is just a distasteful job, like cleaning up sick for a nurse, nothing sexual and you get down on your knees in front of the man, your acceptance and submission clear.  The man smiles and undoes his flies, reaches inside and pulls his cock out.  You then proceed to a skill you have honed to a high degree on Evindium.\n\nWhen you finish, you feel oddly satisfied and when the old man says if he was younger he would of fucked you //good and proper//, you feel oddly disappointed that he wasn’t up for it.

When he does step back you suggest a maintenance cupboard just around the corner and lead him over. When you open the unlocked door, the man is stood behind you, and when he looks in, he propels you forward one hand on your butt. Clearly, he thinks it looks suitable for what he has in mind. \n\nOnce inside you go to town on him, a series of kicks, knees and elbows. Trying your best not to break anything you give a good beating and feel better for it. The man begs for mercy, and you then stop, tell him you are even and you better not see him again, or another kicking will come his way.

You watch with amusement, but after years of recon you quickly spot a number of other people, both male and female, who are not as interested as others. The female of the group is standing by a fire exit and has just disabled the door alarm. Two males are approaching the jewellery counter and you immediately understand what they are up to. Suddenly, your attention is brought to the front of the store again where the agitated male kicks the manager in the balls. Store security chase after the man, but he runs off to the sound of numerous cheers from the crowd. You laugh as certain members of the crowd got in the way of the security officers, giving the man a head start.\n\nThe security officers use a simple chase strategy and chase after the man in a large group. Your attention returns to the two by the jewellery section, who smash the display and start scooping out the contents. The alarm goes off and the two men quickly flee out of the fire exit. You note the operation was quite well done but not overly professional; a couple of them will have been caught clearly on the security cameras. Still, you have to laugh at their audacity as the security officers in the market are authorized to use a lot of force.

This time he appears to be shopping frugally as most of the items are basic, long lasting, and simple food items. You guess he must be on a tight budget. The man’s clothes offer the same impression: cheap, basic and well-worn, but clean. That person clearly cares about that aspect. You decide to follow the man...\n\nNothing much happens in the shop. The man's accomplices are nowhere in sight and any small doubts you had about his identity evaporate when you see a small smile escape his lips when he walks past the jewellery counter. The man also makes an effort not to look at the shop staff. He eventually pays for his items and leaves the shop.

You step closer with the gun and he quickly relents saying you were great in the sack and now he knows why, a great sting operation. You ask Charles whether he meets other girls in the same way and he tells you that he loses count, his life is the show and women. The same is true for Clarice, he tells you there are always women who will sacrifice lots to get higher, Charles admits that he enjoyed having power over Clarice. Charles then asks you where this is going.\n\nYou ask him whether he carries out any checks on the women, Charles being a clever man works out your angle. You’re asking him to show he is lax, Charles admits this and before you carry on, admits that the datapad was not the most secure device but the Head of Security said that espionage was unlikely, though he probably did break some rules. Their biggest worry was not data about the events, but in another production company stealing their ideas.\n\nCharles then finishes by saying he will offer you a cool 100 credits if you go along with his story and shoot Clarice. You add that this was due to Charles breaking the security rules in storing show information on the datapad and by getting totally wasted with strange girls in his apartment. You say this with a little grin on your face and Charles bites, and agrees to what you are saying. You then show Charles the data recorder and say thanks for the confession, before Charles can blurt anything out you shoot him in the head.

Things are not re-enacted exactly as you watch with a twisted satisfaction as Charles hikes up Clarice’s skirt and starts to fuck her. Without any help to warm her up, she winces in pain as her forces her into the desk over and over again. You decide to take a seat in a chair across desk from her so you can watch her face as she is violated. The rush of power from using two people like toys like this only serves to turn you on and you slide a hand down your jumpsuit and start to masturbate.\n\nThe feeling of getting yourself off like this is almost surreal and you make eye contact with Clarice and watch fear in her eyes. \n\n“So Charles, before I blow Clarice’s brains out tell her that me and you are going to split the winnings and this was a setup of Clarice, the bitch took the bait as you expected, I was her type” you purr, watching the anger in Clarice’s eyes\n\nCharles laughs and agrees it all, pinning Clarice’s arms as she starts to struggle. The extra friction and the sheer excitement of the situation causes Charles to cum and Clarice is gently sobbing. As Charles pulls out he makes a pistol gesture with his hands and you point the pistol towards Clarice, then pull out the voice recorder. As Charles eyes widen and Clarice takes interest you pull the trigger ending Charles life. \n\nClarice to her credit pulls herself together, gives you an angry glance then pulls the calm media mask over her face.

Just as your pussy starts its first spasms signalling your climax his friend pulls out and says &quot;Oh Shit...!&quot; before blowing a large load on your face.\n\nThe man’s thrusts become more erratic and he groans as his balls clench and he finally dumps his cum inside of you. He pulls out and before his cum can even begin running down your thighs he offers you some napkins to clean yourself off. When you attempt to clean your face and legs of their cum, he compliments you on being such a great lay and says he hopes to see you around again if he is lucky before walking out of the room with his friend.\n\nWhen you think you’ve done a good enough job that no one will notice.

The apron does not stop your tits from spilling out from both sides, and you are wearing no underwear, leaving you basically naked.  \n\nYou get to work cleaning and wonder what the man is doing when he picks up your dress and corset and locks them away, knowing that the rules are that you speak when spoken to, you shut your mouth and carry on cleaning after a questioning look.  Clearly the man will tell you what he wants in exchange for your dress.\n\nThis becomes clearer when he calls the hotel service desk and says he is very displeased with the service and wants to raise a personal complaint with the Maid Mistress, under your breath you swear, you can guess that you will be in trouble for losing your outfit, or being naked.

You do what you are told and bend over until you are touching your toes, she then attaches the third clip to your clit.\n\n“That is a nasty wet pussy you have there, I’ve got your juices on my hand, get down on all fours and lick your nasty juice off my hand you slut” she exclaims, in a angry sounding voice.\n\nYou do what you are told and lick the offending hand clean, really aware of the old man watching you, excited and amused by the scene.\n\nWhen the Maid Mistress has her hand cleaned to her satisfaction she tells you that you are to finish cleaning the room, remaining on your hands and knees, and that you will use your hands to clean.  When you look at her slightly confused, with the duster in your hand, she takes it from you, lubes it from your //nasty// pussy then inserts it into your butt hole.  You are told to clench it tight and not to let it drop.  The Maid Mistress then tells the old man to sit down and she pulls up a chair to join him, when they are both comfortable she pulls out a remote control and tests the shock boxes….\n\nThe shock hits your nipples and clit with equal force, and though expected you have to try really hard not to drop the duster out of your ass.  You get the idea now, they will have laugh at your expense.\n\n“Right maid, I want you to dust the skirting board with your hands, any marks or stains and you are to use your tongue, drop the duster and I will ram it so far up your ass it won’t be coming out, without medical attention, now GO” she commands. \n\nWith that you start the task going around the room, cleaning, and being shocked at irregular intervals and periods of time.  The worst part is a stain near the bed, you suspect it is a spunk stain, but you try not to think about it and try to get most of it off with your nails and licking your finger.  You are sure the Maid Mistress has noticed by the way she blasts you with the shocker when you wet your finger or scratch the spunk, compared to when you use your tongue.\n\nEventually you finish and are given your dress and corset back and told to return to the waiting room.  The old man gives you a smack on your ass for doing such a good job, you can imagine he will be adding to the stains on the skirting board, for next time. You wonder how fucked up you have become when you wonder if you will get a thumbs up for keeping the duster in your arse?\n\n[[Back to the waiting room|NG1.9]]\n\n</div><div tiddler="Good Game Ending2" tags="" created="201712292229" modifier="twee" twine-position="990,7570">&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th colspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Game Ending 2&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt; \n&lt;/thead&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;&lt;if $Training &lt;= 50&gt;&gt; &lt;img src=data/ge1.png&gt;\n&lt;&lt;elseif $Training &lt; 65 and $Training &gt;= 50&gt;&gt;&lt;img src=data/ge2.png&gt;\n&lt;&lt;elseif $Training &lt; 80 and $Training &gt;= 65&gt;&gt;&lt;img src=data/ge3.png&gt;\n&lt;&lt;elseif $Training &lt;= 100 and $Training &gt;= 80&gt;&gt; &lt;img src=data/ge4.png&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;HEROINE OF THE COMMONWEALTH AND NEW BEGINNINGS&lt;/h1&gt;You give the order for the computer to implement and you have a rollercoaster session watching the holographic feeds.

With his cock out you apply the aphrodisiac and tell Paul you will be back for the best sex ever.\n\nWith Paul waiting you head off and find Lina, who is amusing the men with tales of the fashion industry. You quickly tell them that need them to spread the word that a prank is being played on someone. Remembering Sarah, they all agree, and you ask them to sort themselves out and get everyone, especially Helen. The blokes head off and you tell Lina that you plan to publicly humiliate Paul yourself and the situation, this causes Lina to laugh but you quickly remind her that she will need to watch your back and deal with security if needed. Lina however suggests another option, you still have some of the truth drug and Helen’s mum is walking past, on her own. Maybe you could push the drugs strength and get her to give the gimp a handjob?\n\nAs you head off to test Helen’s mum the party management have turned on a security camera system and are showing the bedroom with Paul, full on exposed hard-on straining in his bonds. This is in the main party area and people are getting ready for the reveal, to find out who has been stitched up in this way. When Helen’s mum walks in and starts to give the masked gimp a hand job there is stunned silence. All that can be heard is a muffled voice saying he wants pussy on top of his cock. What Paul does get is a short lived blow-job as a number of the family flunkies storm in and take Helen’s mum away. Helen’s dad is livid and demands that the masked idiot will suffer, and that he will get to the bottom of this.\n\nYou and Lina quickly head off, wanting to stay to see Paul unmasked but knowing it is a good idea to be out of reach of the security team. You are sure Sarah will be pleased. \n\n[[Mission Accomplished|Mission 4 Debrief][$M4outcome to 3]]\n</div><div tiddler="RPool4D" tags="GAME OVER" created="201508211801" modifier="twee" twine-position="6590,1130">When you enter Ruck'sYou go for a re-match, lose, stripped naked and tied to the pool table and fucked by loads of blokes.

But you reckon you could beat them at pool and offer up, if he wins you will suck him off outside. You need to move anyway and he keeps trying to run his hand further and further up your leg.\n\nThe man asks whether you are serious and is pleased that you are still willing to stick to your word. You then both make your way from the bar over to the pool table where two friends are finishing up a game. You watch the end of the match and hear a few hushed conversations, with the three of them. The few glances you receive are enough for you to know they are talking about you. The grins and looks and the highly flirtatious comments hint at where they hope the evening will go, followed by another round of drinks to try and loosen you up. \n\nWhen the game has finished you're asked to &quot;be a dear and rack their balls&quot;. You bend over to give them an eyeful while you do. You hope this will keep your challenger's mind more focused on a prize he'll never win rather than the game, while you do you feel a finger pulling your skirt up to reveal your lace panties to anyone behind you. \n\nSomehow your display has the opposite effect and he plays an extremely inspired game of pool that is over within minutes. You're both left speechless when one of his friends taps him on a shoulder and reminds him what he has just won.\n\n&quot;I hope you're a woman of your word. Meet me out back in five.

His friend, to your surprise, simply takes a seat in the corner on a stool.  When the man is done undoing his buckle and setting his pants to the side, he makes his way over to you and peels your panties back to reveal you are already soaked.\n\nHe wastes no time pulling his cock through the hole in his boxers and thrust himself deep inside of you. For a guy who gets to have his way with you, he fucks you rather respectfully, never leaving the missionary position.

I'll have a large glass of wine. The name is Celeste, not Miss,&quot; comes your sultry reply.\n\nDutch courage for Shaun, you think to yourself. When Shaun comes back he starts to talk awkwardly at first but opens up as he carries on; it is mostly a one way conversation. Shaun is very naive and it would appear his girlfriend is quite the kinky city girl. Shaun does appear infatuated with you and he makes it even clearer later when he compares you with a college lecturer he fancied crossed with a model. The compliment makes you smile and all this talk of kinky sex, alcohol, and the authority of a 'trusted advisor' has made you quite horny yourself.\n\nYour original intent to give Shaun some advice is falling on deaf ears. It seems Shaun is very much a 'hands on' man, not a listener, and the alcohol is not helping either. He quizzes you on your sex life and loves it even more when you say you have lost count of the men and women that you have seduced over the years. \n\nShaun then asks you, &quot;So will you teach me then?&quot;\n\nHis tone is a half-serious sort-of way. It is clearly the alcohol talking but it is affecting you as well. You then consider a possible third option: Shaun's girlfriend sounds kinky, so maybe you should suggest to Shaun that you have all have a hands on session together. Whatever will you do?\n\n[[Tell Shaun it has been a great night, but it is time for you to go|MArms1E]]\n[[Offer to teach Shaun in the ways of love|MArms1C]]\n[[Suggest that Shaun invite his girlfriend for his ‘education’ session|MArms1D]]</div><div tiddler="MArms1C" tags="Stat_8" created="201507052003" modifier="twee" twine-position="1830,430">You've had a bit to drink, Shaun isn't half bad looking, and he //has// been reasonable company tonight.

At first he can't believe it and thinks you are kidding but after you grab him by the balls he starts to get the picture. \n\n&quot;Come on, Shaun. Let's go back to your place then,&quot; you slur seductively. Shaun nods enthusiastically and goes to hug you, which you stop. &quot;Shaun, you need to understand while I'm going to teach you, I'm not replacing your girlfriend. You need to listen and do what you are told, understand?&quot; Shaun nods, clearly a little disappointed but still very excited.\n\nA short taxi ride later and you arrive at his place. It’s ok but nothing special; a small apartment that’s not quite as dingy as your normal bachelor dive. Shaun comes up with the usual excuses for its state but you cut him off and explain that you two don't need much space and this brings a big smile to Shaun's face. When you get inside, you sit down on the sofa and tell Shaun to strip out of his clothing which he does with great pride. He then stands in front of you, totally naked, his penis already erect.\n\nShaun seems to get into the role and asks, &quot;What now teacher?&quot; \n\nYou tell Shaun to stay where he his while you slowly strip out of your jumpsuit. Once you are nude, you sit back down on the sofa and completely part your legs with a smile. You instruct Shaun on how to carry out basic foreplay actions such as carressing your body, playing with your nipples, and then have him slowly start fingering you. What begins as clumsy thrusts of his fingers slowly changes to the competent sliding and curling buried inside of you. Shaun begins to pick up on your body's natural responses and soon your teaching efforts are rewarded as you cum around his fingers.\n\nShaun looks pleased and you take a moment to collect yourself before moving on to his next lesson. You tell Shaun the next key component to foreplay is his ability to use his tongue to properly please a woman. You spread your legs wide for him and he eagerly starts to lap at your wet pussy. Still freshly sensitive from your previous orgasm, you feel your pleasure start to build faster than anticipated and wrap your legs around his neck, forcing his tongue into you. The second lesson draws to a close as you gush all over his face.\n\nShaun is now getting quite eager and slowly becoming more confident. He says that it must be time to get onto practicing sex positions and you nod. In a gentleman like manner, he offers you his hand to take you to the bedroom. You accept and like young lovers you are led by hand into the bedroom. Just to bring the teacher side out again, you lie down on your back and stretch your legs out so your feet are almost touching your ears. Shaun is shocked by the display, which brings a small smile to your face. \n\n&quot;My god, you are so flexible!&quot; he exclaims. With that, he almost jumps on you and is surprised when you wrap your legs around him and flip him over so you are now straddling his waist. \n\n&quot;Now, Shaun,&quot; you say in a sultry voice that drips with lust, &quot;It is my turn.&quot;\n\nYou push Shaun over and mount him as his cock slides between your folds. You slowly wiggle down to the base of his cock and start to ride him. Shaun lies back and lets you do all the work at first, but when you keep the pace slow enough to deny him an orgasm, he starts to grind against you and reaches for your hips to hold you down. \n\nShaun quickly realizes your leg strength is such that his hands are not capable of restraining you. You bounce up in time to his thrusts, making him lose the friction and denying him the orgasm he longs for. After teasing him for a bit longer, you slow down and get the begin to rock in unison. Shaun calms down and you both start to enjoy the synchronized movements when you suddenly feel the warmth of his cum shooting inside of you. The unexpected jolt of his cum rushing into you puts you over the edge, resulting in your third orgasm of the night.\n\nYou decide to call it an evening and get cleaned up to leave. Shaun asks you whether you will see him again, maybe teach his mates, or meet his girlfriend, Carla. You just give an enigmatic maybe, followed by a little kiss and a playful pat. With that, you leave Shaun to process that all of this actually happened.\n\n[[Return to your apartment|Apartment][$Days = $Days + 0.75]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC8&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;&lt;set $Training = $Training + 1&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="MArms1D" tags="" created="201507052003" modifier="twee" twine-position="1970,430">When you suggest that Shaun give his girlfriend Carla a ring and explain the situation he is ecstatic but worried what she will say. You tell Shaun that if she is truly as kinky as he says, then she will be up for it. Five minutes later, Shaun returns and says that Carla said to come over to her apartment. She is looking forwards to meeting you and he confides that he sent a photo of you over to Carla at her request. You ask Shaun what she said when she saw the photo and he smiles and tells you that you’ll see soon enough. \n\nShaun books a taxi for the short journey over to Carla's apartment. During the taxi ride, he is really excited and puts his hand on your leg a few times and brushes your breasts with his elbow. All 'accidental' touches but he is bursting with excitement as the bulge in his pants blatantly indicates. Carla's apartment is in a modest area of downtown and is quite pleasant; far nicer than your rented apartment, for sure. As Shaun rings the entry buzzer you are buzzed up.\n\nWhile taking the lift, Shaun gropes your butt and tells you you’re going to have a great time. You smile and wonder to yourself whether he has creamed his pants yet. You approach the apartment door and Carla answers it completely naked. This is slightly undermined when she gives you a shy smile and ushers you both inside. \n\nCarla is an attractive woman in her twenties with blonde hair. She is clearly quite the catch for someone like Shaun. Shaun looks flabbergasted and you ignore him to focus on Carla's pert ass swaying as she walks toward the bedroom. Playing Shaun at his own game, you squeeze his butt and push him towards the bedroom and echo his earlier sentiment that’s it’s going to be a great time. As you walk into the bedroom, Carla is already lying down on the queen sized bed on her belly, her eyes resting on you.\n\n&quot;So you are going to help Shaun become a stud I hear,&quot; she says with a bemused tone. You smile back, nod, and start stripping your clothes off. Shaun can’t quite believe his luck, hopping while trying to pull his trousers past his erection. Carla pats the bed next to her and says, &quot;Come here. Not yet for you, Shaun. You can watch.&quot;\n\nShaun does what he is told and you take up Carla's offer and crawl onto the bed, naked, leaving your clothes behind you in a pile. She climbs up and off her belly to a kneeling position, and when you are close, pulls your arms so you both end up kneeling and facing each other. She then embraces you and kisses you passionately. \n\nCarla breaks the kiss, nibbles your ear, and then whispers, &quot;I work as a dominatrix in the Red Light District. Shaun will make a good husband for me, but only if he does what he is told.&quot; As you are digesting this, Carla explores your back with her hands. &quot;Shaun does not know,&quot; she finishes before she breaks from your ear and looks into your eyes. \n\n&quot;//This could be an interesting night!//&quot; you think to yourself. You’re committed to helping Shaun please his girlfriend and Carla is certainly going to call the shots!\n\n[[Let Carla guide the evening|MArms1D1]]</div><div tiddler="MArms1E" tags="" created="201512201847" modifier="twee" twine-position="2250,430">You tell Shaun that you are going to go and he looks so dejected and pitiful that he hits a tender side of you and you decide to stay a little bit longer. After another drink, you have already forgotten you were going to leave and are back to flirting. Shaun tries his luck and his hand starts roving up your thigh. \n\nYou consider slapping his hand away when the warmth of his palm on your inner thigh is followed by a shiver just a slight distance away from it. The sexual tension in the air feels like it is going to burst. &lt;&lt;display [[MArms1C]]&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="RPool4B1" tags="Stat_70" created="201607271350" modifier="twee" twine-position="5330,1130">You shake your head no at his friend and go back to focusing yourself on the sensations on the  man’s cock thrusting inside of you.

You’re almost offended when the man starts to watch the waitress sucking off his friend rather than you while he’s still fucking you. He picks up his pace, you assume to match the pace she is blowing his friend, then seals your embarrassment when he accidentally slips out then shoots his entire load all over your panties.\n\nHis friend doesn’t last much longer and as quickly as he succumbs to the waitress’s mouth, she disappears back to work twice as fast, a credit chip tucked into her bra. Content with how things turned out, both men thank you for being such a good sport and say they hope to see you around again as they will have something special planned for a girl like you before helping you up and ushering you out of the room so they can shoot a few more games of pool.\n\nOn your way out the door, you see the waitress talking to another woman and then they both look towards you and giggle. You hear that you did not perform as expected and Jesse had to cover for you. As you walk out you digest this, Jesse must be the waitress that gave head, were they expecting you to sort them out.

Climbing to the roof is impossible due to the lack of places to grip and the razor wire that lines the edges of all of the overhangs. However, there is a way into the building since you previously ensured that the roof door will release for you. When you get to the roof. you unlock it then bide your time until you hear another shot ring out. Opening it a crack, you see your prey lying down on the edge of the roof, concentrating on her next shot.

As more contestants arrive, she finally starts to get into the swing of things and shouts back at the contestants fucking her, disparaging their cock size and sexual skills. She quickly realizes that you intend to keep things under control when you stop a man from trying to strangle her. She has a genuine chance to survive this and the best option for her and the ratings will be to put on a show.\n\nWhen the last contestant comes, you expect an appearance from the show’s staff, but after a minute or so she gets intimately revisited by two of the contestants at once. This continues until everyone is exhausted and Shadow Viper is sitting up on block, looking defiant.\n\n&quot;Is that... The best all you... Inconsequential //shrimp dicks//... And pussy lickers...

Shadow Viper is pulled to her feet, arms still bound behind her back, fresh cum still dripping from her abused pussy. The security staff look expectantly at you and you know they’re giving you the opportunity to execute her if you wish.

You feel a bit of dread as you move onto this task and hope it is not as painful as your tryout on the throne.\n\nYou are taken to the Japanese themed room by Caroline, the hostess you met during your trial. Caroline is a ‘house hostess’ and was one of the first girls to join the club. She now rarely takes part in bondage activities and generally assists in placing other hostesses in various precarious positions. You think she could almost be compared to a stage director.\n\nAs you arrive at the room, you see it was appropriately named. The room is quite small, devoid of any people and fairly empty, but your eyes are drawn to a couple of spreader bars. You then notice a chain and hoist system attached to the ceiling near it. Caroline watches your eyes and smiles; she does not need to tell you what is going to happen.\n\nYou soon find yourself still in your Shebo costume, having your ankles secured in the spreader bar. This is followed by having your wrists locked into the spreader bar attached to the chain and you know for certain that soon you will be hoisted upwards. \n\nOnce Caroline has locked you in both spreaders, she gives you a little smile and uses a remote control to pull the wrist spreader, currently at waist level, towards the ceiling with an electric whirl. She stops the chain once your arms are pulled at a forty-five degree angle upwards. You’re glad your feet are still fully planted on the floor.\n\n&quot;Celeste, you are quite exposed at this moment,&quot; Caroline says as she eyes your body,&quot; but it is nice sometimes, knowing that you have no control, don’t you think?&quot;\n\n[[Tell her you’d rather be free|Shebo1D]]\n[[Smile and nod|Shebo1D]]</div><div tiddler="Shebo1B" tags="" created="201504272049" modifier="twee" twine-position="1690,1690">You opt for the more provocative approach and when you are in the photo studio you head for straight for an upholstered, wooden chair.

The two guards stay in wait, leaving you there, laid over the table for a few minutes to let your choice and subsequent actions to sink in more fully. Eventually, one speaks up.\n\n&quot;We had a little bet going about how long you were gonna keep us waiting. You are quite the little surprise with how little it took. I think you will take to your new life very well, Number 25. I’m sure your new master may give you a nicer name such as //spunk bucket//,&quot; he says sounding amused then chortles.\n\nThe other guard can’t resist and adds in an pleased voice, &quot;You will probably be asked to lick up the mess that dribbles down your thighs. I bet you are even looking forward to having to do that!&quot;\n\nYou know the guards are trying to humiliate you, to see what resistance is left, so you just stoically tell them to go ahead and have their way you. The guards don't know what to make of it and debate over the whether to fuck you roughly or reward you for your compliant behaviour. They come to a decision and one positions himself behind you and finds your pussy already slick, another shocker for the guards. \n\n&quot;Geez,&quot; the one behind you exclaims. &quot;She is gagging for it! Hey, did we pull Number 33 by mistake?&quot;\n\nThe other guard laughs and you know their defenses are down. You hear the sound of one guard unbuckling his pants, followed by feeling a grip on your hips and a cock nudging around your ass. The other guard walks around the table and takes ahold of your wrists and pins them. They may not be so trusting but you’re sure the guards are just following protocol. You feel the guard behind you press his cock head into you, gently sliding in and out of you until most of his shaft is inside.\n\n[[Make your move|KG4.3][$KG4 to 1]]\n[[Enjoy the feeling for a bit|KG4.2A]]</div><div tiddler="Intel23.12" tags="" created="201705082230" modifier="twee" twine-position="5190,6450">The cyborg is dangerous, if you thought you could, you would have blown her away.

She leaves you and you wait for what feels like at least an actual hour.\n\nStanding for long periods of time isn’t normally an issue for you but after an hour or so spread-eagle, you start to loose circulation in your arms and your legs trying to relieve the pressure. With no-one in the room, you are surprised when the chain is lowered a few inches, taking the pressure off your wrists and your legs.\n\nYou guess that this is not the end but merely the start and you watch as the door opens and a number of familiar faces step into the room.

She will make the perfect femme fatale who strikes and disappears without a single trace.&quot;\n\nSid's boss eases his shoulders, relaxing himself a bit as he considers what he’s being told.\n\n&quot;What is your plan then, Sid?&quot; he asks with a glint in his eye and a small upward curl to the edge of his lip. &quot;I know you always have one.&quot;\n\nSid smiles, relieved his boss seems to be open to hearing more.\n\n&quot;I have gotten Celeste some implants with the best technology money can buy,&quot; he explains, causing his boss to raise an eyebrow. &quot;Let me finish. I had the manufacturer make some custom modifications to the CPU regulating her implant’s neural interface which allows me to access it remotely. I can make changes to her brain chemistry and influence her emotions as I desire.&quot;\n\n&quot;For example, &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Hangar2A&quot;)&gt;&gt;I tweaked her neurotransmitters to heighten her sexual desire when Hugo was flirting with her and look what one of the hangar camera managed to pick up. The bitch was totally wet and rubbing herself up and down the gun barrel!&quot;\n&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;even though I failed to get her to do anything a few days back when Hugo was flirting with her, there were definite signs of increased physical arousal in her,&quot; he says pointing to some readouts showing an increase in her internal temperature in places indicating heavy arousal. &quot;Basically, it worked, but she decided not to have a threesome with Hugo or do anything else sexual, most likely due to her focus on the mission at hand.&quot; &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Hangar2A&quot;)&gt;&gt;\n&lt;img src=data/ship2.4.png&gt;\n&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;\n&quot;So if we can control that pleasure then we can eventually control her?&quot; the boss asks with a grin.\n\nSid takes another puff of his half burnt cigar and nods enthusiastically.\n\n&quot;Exactly! I've been experimenting with her for some time now and she's already showing signs of liking things beyond her previous interests such as bondage. It helps that she's a bit of an exhibitionist and also the occasional party girl. She already finds vanilla relationships to be a bit boring and doesn’t seem interested in a committed relationship, so that should never get in the way. Although I can control the pleasure she receives, we can't actually force her to do anything,&quot; Sid admits, a bit disgruntled. &quot;She has to convince herself that it's what she wants and to give into her body's feelings.&quot;\n\n&quot;Is that why Camilla pretty much orgasms every time she kills someone?&quot; the boss asks, in reference to one of Sid's previous projects.\n\n&quot;Yes,&quot; he acknowledges with a nod. &quot;I've been training Camilla to be an assassin who gains extreme sexual pleasure from sleeping with and then eliminating her targets; she’s the definition of a black widow. Celeste's skills as a whole I’d estimate as five times greater than hers, only being bested in hand-to-hand and close combat capabilities. Even then Celeste’s combat experience would likely give her the edge and she is also capable of infiltrating a target's location since her implants aren’t metallic like Camilla’s. She could sneak past bodyguards and then discretely eliminate a target in their sleep and no one would be the wiser.\n\n&quot;The plan is to make sure Celeste needs to make an unreasonable amount of money fast. She won't have many opportunities on the planet and dirty missions always pay well, especially on planets like Evindium. I'll use every opportunity to influence her mind I can afford and once she's off planet we'll bring her into the fold for good.&quot;\n\n&quot;I like it,&quot; his boss responded approvingly. &quot;Just don't fail me, Sid. I'd rather not have another unstable psycho who is only situationally reliable like Camilla. Speaking of screw ups, wasn’t that mercenary you hired, Hugo, well... Didn’t he turn out to be a traitor?&quot;\n\nSid's worried expression snaps back.\n\n&quot;Camilla is very useful to the organization in her limited fashion. I just overdosed her with too many chemicals and now she is an addict. Hugo,&quot; he says with a hint of anger in his voice, &quot;I'm unfortunately not so sure about. I've sent a team to try and find him and I hope whoever our competition is didn't make any alterations to his cybernetics to get to him before we do.\n\n&quot;I've put together a dossier detailing the plan to train Celeste; a more advanced, subtler, //loyal//, Celeste. She will not be another Camilla. I promise you that, sir.&quot;\n\n&quot;Ok, Sid,&quot; his boss responds as he looks to his computer screen. &quot;I will read the dossier you left me. Don’t disappoint me. You may take your leave now.&quot;\n\nSid bows his head, stands, and nervously walks out of the room knowing that he could lose his best infiltrator if he isn't careful.\n\n[[End of Prologue|GAME GOALS]]</div><div tiddler="Nick5B" tags="" created="201703162052" modifier="twee" twine-position="2950,1970">With a suprising level of control you tell the man that nothing is happening today.

You decide not to as your actions would not necessarily be understood, some would think you are flaunting yourself, others would see it as a statement about demoing female fighters into sex objects. There are a number of female fighters in the gym and you wonder how impressed, or not impressed they are. \n\nThe pants are very tight, it is a struggle to get them on and when you do so you examine yourself in the mirror. It looks like your butt cheeks are trying to eat them and the shape of your genitalia is visible. Moving around a little and some camel toe appears. The crop top is slightly better but with thin material and no bra, your nipples are poking through. Jumping up and down meets your fears that they don’t offer much support and you suspect they may bounce out of the top. \n\nWell you will need to do a training session, you can either go for a weights session which will constrain movement but will mean people can eyeball you in static positions.

With the latter they are closeted away in a VIP area, unsurprisingly with most of the 'groupies' and other management types who ultimately control the money. \n\nYou consider your options, the VIP area is clearly out, and one you are not wearing a short skirt or other outfit exposing parts of your body, two you are not a groupie though the idea is a little pleasing. As your thoughts drift that way you look at the pictures of the muscular male fighters and wonder what they are packing or not in their trunks. The thought sends tingles through you.

You really can’t tell what Maddock is thinking, is he looking down on you for the slutty way you got the access, thinks you are a good agent, or does he want a bit of you?\n\nYou find the thoughts unsettling and you really want to get this sorted and Maddock says he will make contact with Sarah Thornton through the one time email she provided. Once Maddock’s man or girl starts in the IT team Maddock reckons it will be a day or two before he owns the data core.

However a wide eyed serving girl has seen you and falls to her knees in fear. Part of you says to kill her, she may raise the alarm but another part of you says the amount of time saved is negligible. The logical side says if her body is left where it is, the alarm will be raised straight away, if someone finds her then it will take a few minutes to get any sense out of her. Dragging her body away will never cover up the bloodstains. \n\nYou make your escape with no difficulties, keeping a calm detached mindset. When you finally return to your apartment you reflect on what you have just done. Today you have become a paid killer, it may have been better if it was for a worthy cause, but you have just aided one criminal organisation.\n\n[[Mission 9 Debrief]]\n</div><div tiddler="CL2.1B" tags="" created="201611212205" modifier="twee" twine-position="2530,6730">You take out the guards quietly and walk into the after party room, pistols in hand and pointed towards the floor. As you step in it all goes quiet, like a Wild West saloon bar. Eyes take in the sword and knife combo, as well as the pistols. \n\n“Nobody move” you shout and shoot a bodyguard who goes to draw a pistol. The shot hits him clean in the head and the body hits the floor. \n\n“Draw your sword” you say nodding to the Dragon Gang leader. Holding your gaze for a moment he nods, turns round and heads to a rack of swords. Selecting one of them he turns once more and walks towards you, giving commands to the mainly very drunk companions. They form a circle and some are serious, others look at this as part of the night’s entertainment. A couple of the naked girls look very scared, the shock of the death sending them into shaking fits. \n\nWith the duel accepted you holster your pistols, bow and draw your katana. Honour means the Dragon Gang will not interfere in the match but an element of doubt creeps in, what if someone manages to contact security, will you be met by a horde of guards later?  There is no time for doubt as the Dragon Gang leader gives a short discourteous bow and draws his katana. The duel is on and with the worry of reinforcements you aim to make it a quick match. As the first stroke comes in you wonder if perhaps you were a little arrogant here and wonder if maybe you might be outclassed? You don’t let the thought get to you and the fight ends quickly, a double strike, first severing his arm and then taking his head clean off. \n\nThe girls scream and you are confronted with a lot of screaming from the girls, shocked gang members and a few pistols pointed at you. At that moment you feel a moment of panic, you are now at their mercy. It is clear this was an assassination and the intention is clear when the gang’s deputy says that you will die by the sword. With that various gang members collect swords and start advancing and surrounding you. Even the guys with the pistols put the weapons away and collect swords. When the first strike comes in you play your trump card, your high tech blade cuts right through the attackers blade and sheers off part of his skull. Pressing your attack you charge forwards and take out another two. Getting some space you draw your pistols and open up. Within a few seconds the room is a bloodbath but a few gang members escape.\n\n[[Time to get out of here|CL2.1C]]\n</div><div tiddler="CL2.1C" tags="" created="201611212232" modifier="twee" twine-position="2670,6730">You rush out of the room, wondering if you have made a silly mistake in requesting the duel.

Suck on my toe just like you’d tease the head of some losers cock while you suck him off. My other toes need attention too you know!&quot; she says teasing you.\n\nYou try to suck more sensually as she slowly slides her other toes into your mouth until it is stuffed with all of her toes.

There is something almost zen-like to this simple act of submission and you find yourself getting lost in the act.\n\nWhile in this dreamy state you hear Carla softly asks, &quot;Are you enjoying worshipping my perfect, little feet, Celeste?&quot; You can only nod in agreement as you continue to suck on her foot. &quot;Then would you like to cum while in their presence, slave?&quot; You feel a gush of wetness inside your panties and nod in agreement as you suck more vigorously.\n\nCarla pulls her foot out of your mouth as strands of drool run down its sides. She then lifts the soles of both of her feet and press them against your face. This unbalances your senses as your vision is suddenly taken from you and you are overwhelmed by a familiar, but stronger fragrance compared to how her toes had tasted.

The next bit shocks you more, the core code of the implants has been changed on a number of occasions, even whiles you have been on Evindium.  Mainly small changes and before you ask Maddock tells you he does not know what has been changed. Maddock is no expert on implants which are essentially very, very complex computer systems.

The slut approaching him now stirred some excitement to his loins, admittedly there were lots of sluts in the Red Light district but recently many seemed a little scared, like they could sense his intentions towards another woman. Or maybe lurking for hours in the same spot freaked some people out? This slut however did not seem scared at all, probably on a lot of drugs Hugo thought.\n\n&quot;You looking for a good time big boy&quot; the girl asked, giving him her best eyeful and encouraging smile. \n\nHugo haggled on the price, not that he had any intention of paying, he was going to break her neck after he finished. Stupid girl he thought, no street walker survives with working under protection, looking around he could see no surveillance devices, nor pimps or other protection. The girl took him back to her rented room, again Hugo paid great attention to the place, but there was no security. Great if you want to hide from someone, but not great if you are running a business with your pussy. The thought of what Hugo was going to do to the girl was getting him excited and he hurriedly paid up after he entered her room.\n\nHugo did not bother with any foreplay just pushed the girl onto the bed, got his cock out and got on top. The girl smiled and spread her legs, showing the lack on underwear under her dress. With the girl still dressed and her handbag over her shoulder Hugo started to fuck her, slightly surprised by her wet pussy and enthusiastic reaction. Hugo started fucking her as hard as he could do, trying to hurt her and wrapped his hand around her neck, the girl looked terrified and started to reach in her handbag, probably reaching for a self-defence spray or knife Hugo thought and squeezed tighter and continued roughly fucking her, close to climax. \n\nHugo did not know what to look the surprised about, the fact that he could not crush the girls windpipe, or the item that came out of the handbag. It was a round flat object that looked like an magnetic explosive charge, before he could react the girl stuck it on his forehead and then grabbed his wrists, Hugo found it hard to move his wrists, the girl was strong inhumanly strong and was keeping them round her neck;\n\n&quot;Fuck me Hugo, give me the best you got big boy&quot;\n\nWith those words and a growing panic Hugo stopped fucking her, but the girl had wrapped her legs around him and prevented an easy withdraw.\n\n&quot;What is that on my head bitch&quot; Hugo snarled\n\n&quot;It’s a headache tablet Hugo&quot; the girl said with a big smile while trying to take in Hugo’s cock\n\n&quot;HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME&quot; Hugo screamed, his fear getting out of control. Hugo never heard the answer, the item attached to his head exploded inwards melting through Hugo’s cyborg skull plate and frying the mix of human and artificial brain within. \n\nDying for a cyborg does not result in the body going floppy, instead everything stayed the same and the girl rolled Hugo over on the bed and laughed as the remaining part of the mag charge fell off Hugo’s head leaving a smoking hole the size of an eyeball in the forehead. Taking Hugo’s still hard cock within her the girl spoke;\n\n&quot;I know your name Hugo as I came here to kill you, don’t mess with Sid, oh by the way mine is Camilla&quot;\n\nShortly afterwards Camilla sorted herself out and went outside to wait, to catch a glimpse of Blake.

Who are you and what will happen if I give you the data core?&quot;\n\n&quot;Let me tell you a story Celeste,&quot; Maddock replies. &quot;You know that [[Evictor mercenaries|Evictor Mercenaries]] were designed by Xena Corp. and probably even that they don’t manufacture them due to regulations on private and corporate militaries. If Xena wants to utilize their talents, they have to hire an Evictor mercenary company the same as anyone else. The reality is that Xena are manufacturing an army in secret. I’m sure you’ll point out that there have been investigations into Xena’s facilities before, but what would happen if they were being aided by an outside party, say, by a mining company?\n\n&quot;Lantis Corporation hate Xena because their operations puts Lantis’s mining at risk,&quot; you quickly reply.\n\n&quot;Ah... That //is// what the public is lead to believe,&quot; he says with a smug grin. &quot;But tell me, Celeste: What if Lantis were creating underground facilities for Xena? After all, most of their mining is already automated and the only need for human input is in the logistics and for mechanical repairs.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then Xena could be building an army of Evictors undetected,&quot; you say as everything starts to fall into place in your head. &quot;The only way you could possibly know all of this is if you aren’t freedom fighter. You are working for the Commonwealth Hall of Justice in an unorthodox manner; maybe even off the books.&quot;\n\n&quot;I need a cover,&quot; he responds, his tone implying some surprise you pieced it together so quickly. &quot;Xena are too good at spotting Commonwealth agents. I do my part by running a shabby operation that is a nuisance for them, knowing that past the jumpgate everything is mainly under their control!&quot;\n\nYou nod. You aren’t overly surprised because you have been part of a number of less than moral missions for government. What is surprising is that the ingenuity of it all as it has people like Mr. Grayson believing and participating in it. Before you ponder further, Maddock continues.\n\n&quot;We think Lantis and Xena are pooling their efforts and we don’t know for what reason. I won’t share what I speculate is happening but this data core could shed some light on things. So, //Miss Blake//, are you in?&quot;\n\nYou pause, weighing up the risks\n\n&quot;Celeste we have done some background checks,&quot; Maddock says trying to prompt you. &quot;I know you are a very wealthy New Terra resident, but do you only care about money?

Even more confused you break off eye contact and your thoughts seem to become clearer.\n\n&quot;Hello Celeste&quot; she purrs, &quot;I'm M, another M, a colleague of M you have been dealing with, not his lackey, remember that Celeste&quot; she tells you, her voice changing from a purr to a sterner tone.\n\nYou find yourself not wanting to look the women in the eye, your eyes dart all around her, taking in the outfit, the appearance and the face.

The lure of drinks, good games of pool, fit men and women, flirting, a chance to flaunt your body, seeing Carla, and a chance for sex are simply irresistible. You also normally take a month off after each mission: two weeks relaxation and then two weeks of preparation. The stress of your current situation means you need to get the 'relaxation' in whenever you can. &lt;&lt;if $PoolSex is 1&gt;&gt;You remember how the last pool night ended with you getting fucked like a dirty slut in an back alley while a crowd of people watched you. \n\nYou don't know why the thought of something that started out private turning into a spectator sport turns you on so much. You suppose it happened gradually... You remember the first time you had sex on the beach was only enhanced by the thrill of the fact you could get caught. When you were eventually caught you were so embarrassed but as time passed the memories became less embarrassing. Some people still judge you though.

The next press of her lips comes a few inches above that, and then another follows in the same suit. All of her kisses linger for seconds at a time and this continues until you can feel her warm breath onlt centimeters from your aching, wet pussy.\n\nJust as you expect her next kiss to finally meet your lower lips, instead it travels now on to the same place on your opposite thigh. Her kisses now barely move at all as they slowly travel up to your pubic mound, before she finally gives you what you crave.\n\nAll it takes is a single, passionate suckling kiss upon your clit for your juices to rush out onto her chin. You let out a low moan, or tried to, until you began choking on Selina's panties inside your mouth. This causes Selina and Jess to burst out in laughter, before Selina removes them from your mouth so you could breathe.\n\nRather than give you time to collect yourself, Sam's kisses resume and make their way upwards along your stomach until they reach your bosom. She traces each of your breasts with her mouth, before stopping to gently flick your nipples with the tip of her tongue; all of this done while looking up at you with her deep, blue eyes.\n\nHer kisses dance along your collar bones and to the nape of your neck, where she places some playful soft bites that were too gentle to leave marks. Sam's mouth finally comes to a rest on your lips and your head is spinning from how much you desire her every touch. You suddenly feel your legs being hoisted and pulled apart at your knees and something cool press against your throbbing entrance. It is then that the kiss breaks and you look down between her legs to see a large strap-on resting between her legs and pressed against you.\n\n&quot;I've thought you were cute from the moment I saw you, Celeste,&quot; Sam mutters in a hushed tone, clearly embarrassed. &quot;I was originally doing this because Selina is a good friend, but I can't wait to have you. I hope you liked when I was teasing you with my foot under the table earlier.&quot;\n\nSam trails off as you feel the strap-on easily slide past your wet lips, filling you as your pussy greedily pulls it deeper. You let out a loud moan and Selina walks over to you and drops a wet thong in your mouth that tastes much sweeter than her panties did.\n\n&quot;These were Sam's from while she watched Jess and I toy with you,&quot; she sneers.\n\nSam starts fucking you harder and harder, clearly turned on by this revelation. Your combined juices are soaking the floor beneath you and as you slowly slip forward, you are greeted by Jess's hand to brace you. Instead of just supporting you, you feel one of her fingers circle your anus before one presses inside of it, eliciting a muffled moan from your mouth.\n\nJess's finger meets little resistance and soon the whole length of her finger is pumping in and out of you in rhythm with Sam's strap-on. You get lost in the ecstasy of having your holes plugged as another orgasm quickly starts to build inside of you.\n\n&quot;Oh my... I'm going to... Ahh!&quot; Sam starts as she closes her eyes and she thrusts hard as her voice drops. You join her in the throes of orgasm as your pussy and ass clench around what fills them. You feel yourself get dizzy as you come down from the orgasm and Sam and Jess pull out of your aching orifices. You aren't sure you can take much more of this as your vision slurs further momentarily.\n\n&quot;Get up and get that thing off of Sam,&quot; Jess bellows as you notice a smaller, dildo in her hand. &quot;It's my turn to get to use this little fuckslut. I need the harness so I can have her ass.&quot;\n\nYour eyes go wide as you try and plead through Sam's thong. You know there is no way your body can handle getting fucked like that right now... although some part of you wants to know what it would be like to let Jess use you with how sadistic she has come across. \n\nSelina walks over and pulls Sam's thong from your mouth.\n\n&quot;Well, what is it slut?&quot; she asks scathingly.\n\n[[Ask for mercy|Random SQ3.5][$MercySel to 1]]\n[[Beg Jess to fuck you|Random SQ3.5][$Mental += 2]]</div><div tiddler="Random SQ3.5" tags="Stat_64" created="201603111834" modifier="twee" twine-position="5890,2810">&quot;...

You try and lift yourself with your arms, but they’ve become too weak, so you are stuck with your ass and pussy in the air while you're pressed into her cunt.\n\nYou begin to worship her pussy like your life depended on it; there was a small chance it even may. It quickly became evident by Selina's increasingly vocal moans that you were doing something right and you started to feel the faintest trace of your own orgasm start to build once more. Suddenly you feel the tip of someone’s nose part your lips as they press and run their tongue over your clit, causing you to stop and moan into Selina's pussy.\n\n&quot;Haha,&quot; you hear Jess's laugh echo through the tiny bathroom. &quot;I knew you had the hots for her, you little slut, Sam!&quot;\n\nYou had just resumed licking Selina when Sam withdrew from you to offer her retortcausing you to jolt once more.\n\n&quot;Shut up! Her face is just so cute when she's turned on and I happened to like the taste of her juices when I licked her there earlier,&quot; she indignantly explains before returning her attention to your lower lips.\n\n&quot;This is all very touching and all,&quot; Selina bellows, &quot;but if she stops licking me one more time, I swear Jess is getting to fuck her ass.&quot;\n\nYou wince at the thought and redouble your efforts to make her cum.\n\nYou hear Jess messing with something in the background as Sam starts to increase the intensity of her own tongue work. You can feel an orgasm inside you starting to build as your vision starts to blur and you feel your jaw momentarily go limp.\n\n&quot;Uggh! What did I fucking just tell you?&quot; you hear Selina scream as you get your feeling back and start to lick. You feel Selina grasp and your head and force your face to grind against her pussy. &quot;She's yours, Jess. Fuck her ass!&quot;\n\nYou hear a disappointed Sam sigh as she pulls away from your pussy, only moments from orgasm, as it throbs in desperation. You barely manage to look up at Selina with pleading eyes before you hear a hum and feel the buzzing head of the apparent vibrator Selina has harnessed press up against your asshole.\n\nAs your ass opens up to the buzzing device about to penetrate it, you feel a surge of intense sensations flood to your head. Your eyes flutter and you gasp as you concurrently cum and your vision goes white.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Please... Please fuck my ass!&quot; you somehow manage as a light yell. All three girls break out into a fit of laughter at your response and you feel a familiar heat in your lower regions from the humiliation.\n\n&quot;Well, Jess,&quot; Selina responds while trying to stifle her laughs, &quot;it looks like she is all yours. Actually, why don't I have her eat my pussy at the same time so that I get to cum, too?&quot;\n\n&quot;Sounds fun,&quot; retorts Jess, before grabbing your arms with Sam while Selina positions herself with her legs spread in front of you. Sam and Jess gently lower your face in-between her legs and you are greeted with the musky aroma of her sex.\n\nYou start licking the juices from her outer lips before parting them to search for more with your tongue. While you begin to lick away, you hear a hum from behind you, as Jess's harnessed vibrator press against your puckered asshole.\n\n&quot;The vibrations make it easier for it to slide in,&quot; Jess states as she places her right hand on your hip while adjusting the position of the vibrator with the other. \n\n&quot;Plus I'm not as turned on just from the act like Sam, so I can't cum from just smashing into you alone. Speaking of Sam, I slipped in quite a bit of lube I had in my pack in that tight little ass of yours, so I expect I'll slide in fairly...&quot; she says pressing the tip against your anus.\n\nYour hole quickly submits and draws in the tip of her toy, causing you to let out a low, rumbling moan.\n\n&quot;Easily,&quot; Jess finishes, as she rocks it deeper inside you with a triumphant thrust for emphasis.\n\n&quot;Mmmmmm. Fuck her hard, Jess. Her mouth is practically vibrating from you,&quot; Selina coos as she presses your head into her mound.\n\n&quot;With p-pleasure,&quot; Jess stutters as she thrusts in deeper, filling your ass. You feel your vision blur as the heat inside you feels like it is going to burst. After grinding against you a few more times, Jess pulls the vibrator out which causes your fingers to claw at the ground due to the sudden emptiness.\n\n&quot;Aww, do you want it back?&quot; Jess teases as she presses the tip against your rear entrance once more. You whimper affirmatively into Selina's pussy and Jess pushes the entire length of the vibrator into your ass in a single thrust, causing your pussy to convulse as your juices splashed onto the floor. As your orgasm subsides and Jess keeps railing into your ass, you feel your vision start to fade as your muscles give out.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\n\n[[Pass out|Random SQ3.6]]\n&lt;&lt;if $MercySel != 1&gt;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC64&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Mental = $Mental + 3&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $Days += 0.25&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="SC12.1" tags="" created="201601160201" modifier="twee" twine-position="7570,710">//What if some person or group managed to perfect the science behind the supposed art?//\n\nYour ''Submission'' has increased by 1.5%.\n\nSid was impressed and felt there was a business opportunity here.

That's ok though,&quot; she says pulling her hand from beneath the waist of her skirt, a pair of wet, balled up panties now poking out from between her fingers. &quot;You see, I was prepared for a screamer.&quot;\n\nSelina pulls your head up by your hair before forcing her sopping panties into your mouth. They taste bitter and there is almost no way they got this wet through normal wear.\n\nAs if reading your mind, Selina adds, &quot;When I stopped at that bathroom earlier, I stuffed my panties inside my pussy and masturbated quickly. I've been wet this entire time thinking about what we're about to do to you.&quot;\n\nSelina releases your head before stepping back away from you.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You realize it is likely hopeless to think someone would help you even if they heard your screams, so you stay in a daze, watching Selina's hand working beneath her waistband.\n\n&quot;I'm surprised,&quot; Selina says, bringing a balled hand out from under her skirt that has fabric peaking from between her fingers. &quot;I expected more of a fight out of you.&quot;\n\nSelina takes a step and slides one of her feet forwards between your legs and starts to rub your wet lips, causing you to open your mouth and moan. Selina takes the opportunity to stuff the contents of her hand inside your mouth, and you are greeted with the salty, musky aroma of what has to be her panties. The material is completely soaked with her juices and you can feel them begin to run down your throat.\n\n&quot;I hope you like how I taste,&quot; she purrs sinisterly. &quot;Then again, it doesn't matter what you like right now either way. They're so wet because I slipped them inside me and masturbated when I stopped at the public bathroom earlier.

She squats down next to you and nibbles on your ear as you feel the tip of the knife trail along the soft skin of your breasts.\n\n&quot;I'd have done this to a hot bitch like you even if Selina hadn't asked me,&quot; she whispers in your ear. \n\nYou feel her swiftly slide the knife down between the cups of your bra, before pulling the knife back and slicing through it. Your breasts bounce free as your body shivers and you notice Jess bite her lip.\n\nJess runs her fingers down your newly exposed flesh before slipping them down into your panties. Without the slightest hint of tenderness or care, you feel her curl and thrust two fingers inside your wetness. \n\nShe kisses your cheek as you moan, before you feel her arm with the knife shift, then your waistband snap as her kisses trail to your lips. Your panties sink away leaving you completely exposed as Jess bites your lip before pulling away.\n\nJess stands and moves to the side as you start to feel dizzy and your pussy burns with a desire to cum. You vision is starting to get faintly fuzzy, but you can clearly make out the redhead Sam, on all fours, waiting between your parted legs.

That's it for the sides of the room. \n\nThe ceiling lights mark the points of an octagon, all shining inwards at the centre of the room and leaving the corners in shadow. What's in the middle of the room is obviously meant to be the centre of attention, so much so that you're almost sure it's not a distraction. It's too obvious to be a subtle trick to make you overlook something else. You look behind you instead and there is no change. The door still says you can leave if you want to, but that'd be blowing off your meeting. Having looked around at everything else, you look back at the middle of the room.

Then it's a hand, the flogger, the belt, or another man taking you while your ass is given a rest. The more they beat you, the more you hope it's another man to fuck you, and another and another, uninterrupted.

You manage to raise your arm and sling the object from your face and realize these must be Jess's panties from earlier. You feel a tickling on your breasts as you move and look down to see Sam's thong and Selina's panties still covering your breasts.\n\nYou orient yourself only to realize that you are still in the bathroom from before. After the girls had their fun, the apparently dragged you to a stall and left you naked and spread legged on a toilet after covering you in their panties.\n\nYou notice your clothes neatly folded next to the toilet with your boots stacked on top with a small data chip resting between them. You try to stand to get dressed and your legs nearly give out as you feel a shooting pain from your groin and ass.\n\nYou look down and realize that the girls also left both of your holes stuffed with the toys stuffed in your holes for however long you were passed out. As you attempt to gently slide them out, you grit your teeth at how raw each ravaged hole feels. After catching your breath for a moment, you manage to stand up and prop yourself against the wall well enough to get dressed. You carefully tuck the data chip into your pocket before gathering up the toys along with the girls’ underwear and dropping them into the trash.\n\nYou stumble out of the bathroom, disheveled, and make your way out of the entrance while Mrs. Fong watches on with a smile. You hail a taxi back to your apartment and it hurts to sit the entire short ride back. Once you've paid the cab driver, you make your way in and collapse on your bed before loading up the data chip. All it contains in a single audio track.\n\n//&quot;Heeeeey, Celeste. I hope you slept well,&quot;// rings out the familiar voice of Selina before she giggles. //I'm sure you love the gifts we left you. Jess was just so soaked after she rammed your ass for half-an-hour, she just had to leave that behind as the first thing you'd smell when you woke up.&quot;\n\n&quot;Anyways, the point of all this is after we finished up with you, we carefully positioned your body for quite a few compromising photographs I'm sure you wouldn't want released very publically. My daddy even has some connections in the media, so I could draw extra attention to them if necessary.\n\n&quot;So, I'm sure you don't want this to happen, so the next time I see you, and I ''will'' be seeing you again ''many'' more times, I expect you to pay me ten credits to stop me from leaking them. And if you were foolish enough you can't even afford that because you already spent all of your money, I may be generous enough to offer you a humiliating alternative to keep me from leaking them.\n\n&quot;If I want to find you, I'll send you a message and we can meet up by the entrance to the teahouse. See you around and I hope you've learned better than to humiliate me like that again, you stupid bitch!&quot;// she screams as the audio cuts.\n\nYou let out a sigh as you now have one more minor annoyance to deal with; at least she isn't blackmailing you for much. With how achy your muscles still are, you sink into the bed as you decide it best to take the next day to rest your sore muscles and let your implants finish filtering out whatever she slipped into your system.\n\n[[Take time off to recover|Apartment]] &lt;&lt;set $SQRP to 4&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;set $Days += 1&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Shebo5" tags="" created="201711122208" modifier="twee" twine-position="4910,1690">After completing the trials, you find that you have furthered your celebrity status, in this fucked up venue.  You are now the first independent hostess, that is one not tied to the various groups. Tied being the word.  This, while good makes everything you do unfamiliar territory. \n\nOne of the friendlier girls has given you some advice, that you should fuck as many of the people possible, while charging high rates, while you still have the celebrity status.   You get it, the girls here are exploited and few seem to last more than a few years, the ones that seem to stay are those who are hooked up with the management.  The rumour is that all the girls that have come and gone are now rich mistresses, which attracts more girls. &lt;&lt;if $Mis7 is &quot;Complete&quot;&gt;&gt;You have a different idea, some of the girls are kidnapped and turned into sex slaves. You have a feeling that some or not all of the management know what is happening. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\n\nBack to the current you soon find out that the management want a phot shoot, a lot of the members want to take some photo’s of you. Selfies, group shots or just satisfying the new fad of using antique cameras to take still shots. You don’t get it, but they are paying and being strapped to some device is nothing new, you just hoped you could flounce around in your hostess outfit and see if all of this actually leads anywhere?  Once you complete the photo shoot, you are told you will be expected to meet and greet all tables, this will be your best chance to see if anything comes from all this.\n\n[[Time to strip off for the photoshoot|Shebo5A]]\n</div><div tiddler="CH4.1" tags="" created="201611061632" modifier="twee" twine-position="1830,2250">40 credits is not a great deal, but very good for a few hours work…….. You’re not sure it should be called work, unless you’re a porn star, but this is about saving yours and Jane’s life, keeping the ship and after a few more missions you can go into semi-retirement with a few raunchy memories behind you. Will this be one of them, a wrestling match, in a bar, with an audience and covered in baby oil? You are not sure if you are trying to convince the more prideful and rational side of you. The thing is, you might win if the wrestler can’t pin you, if he does pin you, well you have a couple of other chances. But wrestling in skimpy clothing, covered in baby oil?\n\nIf you totally mess it up well then you will be a porn star carrying out a live show, for the enjoyment of the crowd in the Cock &amp; Hen. When you arrive the Cock &amp; Hen is empty and a small arena has been created in the main bar area, four wrestling mats surrounded by barriers and a number of extra bouncers set the scene. There is a sea of faces all looking at you with grins, the manager of the Cock &amp; Hen is ecstatic as this is a tickets only event and they sold the whole lot.  The promoter gets your attention and leads you back stage and then hands you your outfit, basically a bit of skimpy sports clothing. You are told that you have 25 minutes to get your gear on and oil yourself up as the doors are open. \n\nA female promotions girl, or eye candy offers to help get the oil in places you can’t reach. You take the help as your slipperiness is the only thing that will get you through this. You strip off and the girl in just a bikini starts applying oil to your body, she starts off in a business-like manner, but when she gets to your tits, it seems more like fondling and when she tweaks one of your rapidly hardening nipples you know she is doing it on purpose. Then you see the camera and realise you have been set up, you getting ready has been the warm up for the audience. You feign ignorance of the camera, not wishing to provide more entertainment to the crowd and remove her hands moving them upwards and away. The girl carries on, back to the professional manner and when she is finished passes you your outfit. \n\nOnce you are decent the promoter is given the all clear to visit you in the changing room though you have no doubt he was directing the camera all the time. You still have 8 minutes left and you evilly suggest that the promotions girl should get the same treatment, the girl goes to speak but the promoter cuts her off and sullenly she returns back to the room. She tries to move away from the camera but you position her at the best angle and start on her legs. You don’t try to make it professional but apply it seductively, slowly and spending more time on the erogenous zones.  You turn her facing you and reach round to do her butt cheeks, this causes both your tits to meet in the middle and you then grind her butt towards you, pelvis to pelvis. The girl squirms, but the roaring of the audience in the main bar area stops her. She knows what you are doing and that now you have started she had better go along with it. You whisper in her ear that she might get a rise, the thought had dawned on her as well and she hugs you back and you both share a brief passionate kiss. So passionate was the kiss that you are unsure whether she was acting, or truly has been caught up in the mood. \n\nTime is running out though so you pull away, turn her around and start on her tits, pushing up the bikini top and massaging her DD implants. She puts on a show grinding her backside into your groin and your senses indicate that you are now late and the promoter is putting the start back due to this impromptu show. The door to the fitting room opens and a voice is heard, ladies you’re late, time to get out. The audience roars in laugher, the more stupid thinking they were interrupting a show, some boo. \n\n[[Make your way out|CH4.2]]\n</div><div tiddler="RPool3B5" tags="Stat_15" created="201508252134" modifier="twee" twine-position="3930,1130">Craig takes no time following your command. He pulls his fingers out of your pussy, steps behind you, and sticks his pussy juice covered fingers by your lips where you instinctively begin to suck. Craig then pushes you down so your tits are pressed against the pool table and pulls your panties down to your knees. A quick unbuckling of his trousers follows and you feel the head of his cock part your lips; it slides in and you let out a guttural moan.\n\nCraig continues to ram into you with no thoughts for your own pleasure. His hands holding your hips maintain a firm pressure pulling you towards him as his thrusts ram you into the table. Though the table is in a quiet spot, a few people do walk past; some look embarrassed, some give him a thumbs up, and then Carla arrives.\n\nCarla finds the whole thing hilarious and teases you saying, &quot;Celeste, I never knew you were such an exhibitionist!&quot; \n\nYou grunt in acknowledgement as Craig is finally hitting your spot and your mind is becoming mush. Soon the orgasm hits you and Craig climaxes into your spasming pussy. As he pulls out, you feel the sexual fluids drip onto the ground as some of it begins running down your leg. She smiles and passes you a tissue to helps mop some of it up, but you head off to the bathroom to finish cleaning up.\n\nWhen you get back, Craig offers to play you in another game of pool. \n\n[[Play pool|RPool3C]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC15&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Training = $Training + 2&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Mental = $Mental + 0.5&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="SH3.2" tags="" created="201804022258" modifier="twee" twine-position="3090,2950">Tyrone looks at you, he is really tempted you can tell, but then speaks;\n\n&quot;I want a threesome, to seal the deal&quot;, he says sounding quite firm.\n\nYou think about it before answering, &quot;I'll have to speak to Jane&quot; you tell him, causing Tyrone to break into a smile.\n\n&quot;If the boss is up for then I'm sure I know the answer, after all you are risking your backside for her, and my men say she is gagging for a good fucking!&quot;\n\nYou cringe slightly at his comment about Jane but acknowledge to yourself he is probably right. The thing is a threesome does not bother you in the least, but with Jane you have remained just friends. You have seen her naked, got drunk with her, had nearly had sex in the same room as her with a bloke you were with. This will be different? You ask Tyrone for a moment alone and call Jane, you explain the situation and let that sink in, then tell her they want //favours//, then tell her that they want favours from her and then finally favours from both of you.  Silence......\n\n&quot;Celeste, I'm ok with it, it is just sex, right?&quot; she says, pausing, &quot;Look to be fair, a night out, some drinks, a lot of drinks and sex with an ok guy is basically alright, yeah. As long as the place is safe I'm cool with it, listen some of the smugglers have been flirting with me big time, and you know some tension has been building, and I'm pretty bored and horny down here&quot; she goes on.  You talk for a bit longer and find yourself convinced, oddly enough Jane says nothing about sharing a bloke with you, does it matter?\n\nYou find Tyrone and tell him you will go for it, you just need to make sure the place is safe, that alcohol is available and go through arrangements of getting Jane there, unseen by any surveillance cameras. Tyrone is chuffed to bits and outlines a plan, it is clear he has thought it all through....... in detail.\n\nYou agree with a shiver through your body to today.

A fairly neutral meeting spot right on the edge of the city near a rat warren of slums and industrial units ensures either party could make a quick getaway. Not seeing Max around yet, you take a seat at the bar and order yourself a drink.\n\nAs you wait for your order, you surreptitiously look around the bar once again and spot a couple of familiar faces from the Hyper Market raid. Attention to detail is something you are very good at as well as keeping a low profile. One of the watchers leaves and a few minutes later Max comes in and walks over in your direction. You grab your drink and he joins you in a quiet corner of the bar you picked out.\n\n&quot;Hello, Celeste. I came like we agreed...&quot; he states in a quiet, curious voice.\n\n&quot;Why don’t you invite your companions over as well? Before you deny it, know that I recognize a few of them from the hypermarket&quot; you say in matter of fact tone with a smile, trying not to startle him.\n\nMax looks a bit worried and admits that he was not sure of your intentions and he does not like taking chances with people whose motivations are not clear. This was your first test of the man’s honesty and now it was your turn. You explain that you are looking to get someone off planet who is wanted by a corporation you won’t name. An unknown person, an unknown corporation, and Max’s current position of being poor will guarantee he is incapable of double crossing you. To be fair, Max doesn’t seem like the type that would sell you out but desperate men often do desperate things.\n\nMax digests this and says that you could have turned him for the twenty-five credit reward from the Hyper Market and instead you have met him here and you know they have no money. You tell him that you thought the Hyper Market raid was a good amateur job and you were looking for people to help pull off tasks for you in your mission to get one over on the corporation.\n\nYou ask Max for his story and how he got where he is. Max looks at you for a few long moments and then starts up and his tale almost makes you lose your stoicism. Max and all his ‘crew’ all used to work for the Xena Corporation but were fired a number of months ago when their loyalty was questioned. Xena Corp asked staff to complete a survey and those saying that they would consider careers elsewhere or who gave answers that the computerized analysis did not approve of were kicked out. All those fired were banned from getting jobs on Evindium for other corporations and those with enough savings got a one way ticket off the planet. Those who could not afford space travel and the visas required were marooned with no assistance. You suspect that Xena Corp’s actions are linked to the data breach that you were involved in. They must have realized they had a mole in their organization and went to extreme measures to reduce the workforce.\n\nYou learn what Max and his people did and there are a mixture of jobs: some were IT, some were junior lab staff (none who worked on secret projects), and some were business management staff. All junior to mid-grade, none with any military experience, but a motivated and resourceful bunch totaling around twenty-five people all told.  \n\nYou reckon it would cost around three-hundred credits to get them all off planet. This doesn’t account for the money necessary to keep them alive on whatever planet they go back to admittedly. You ask how many have family who would take of them and around half have strong family links. The downside being is that Xena Corp preferred employees who don’t have strong family ties as it made them feel Xena Corp was their only family. That would add another one-hundred or so credits to give them a life line once they escape this place.\n\n//Damn!//\n\nFour-hundred credits is a solid amount and you would really need to give them some upfront to gain their trust. The other option is whether you could set them up on Evindium itself. Challenging but maybe cheaper.\n\n[[Offer Max twenty-five credits to start|Intel12.1]]\n[[Walk away from Max|Intel12.2]]</div><div tiddler="NG1.8A1" tags="" created="201711292139" modifier="twee" twine-position="2530,990">You take the spanking like a good maid, no fuss, just a few grunts and offering no resistance.

With that she leaves the room, leaving you to head back to the waiting room for your next task.  At this rate it could be a long night. \n\nYou have learnt one thing, the guest left with a big smile on her face, she really enjoyed it and the whole thing is a game.

You take the rest, making the noises in the right places and end up with a stinging ass and a flushed face, aroused by your acting and the guests orgasmic expression.  \n\nWhen the spanking has finished both the guest and the Maid Mistress looked pleased with the outcome and the Maid Mistress escorts the guest out of the punishment room, as she leaves she tells you that you will report back to the waiting room immediately.

The wrestler is getting over confident and in this round if you concentrate you can probably end it in your favour, the problem is part of you is quite relaxed about losing, the whole idea of it sends palpitations through you and you suppress a shudder of excitement.\n\nWhat is wrong with you these days you wonder to yourself? It could be argued that agreeing to this helps you get off planet, but is this about prostituting yourself? Degrading yourself to get money, but the mercenary work is hardly full of morals, nor was your military career. Can you judge girls who use their bodies for advancement? Are you now one of them, but do you get off on it?\n\nAs the round starts these thoughts don’t go away and the wrestler quickly takes advantage of your distraction and takes the fight to the ground, you find yourself scrabbling around your knees as the wrestler tries to plant you face first on the ground by wrapping his hands behind your neck. You can’t break the hold, and you need to put your hands on the floor to stop yourself being pinned. Eventually you succumb to the inevitable and find yourself face first on the mats, pinned by the wrestlers arms. \n\nOnce the referee calls the pin he releases you but places his hand on the small of your back to stop you getting up. You bring yourself to your elbows and watch the topless event girl pull her bikini bottoms off and spin them around, before launching them out to the crowd. The crowd roars as they catch sight of her shaven muff. The wrestler then spanks your bottom and gives your trunks a tug exposing the top your buttocks. Your face burns in embarrassment as you realise that in this round you were totally dominated. In a normal MMA fight you are far better than the wrestler, but here he is setting you to be his cock sleeve. With a further yank your trunks come down to your knees where they remain. \n\n“Get up” says the wrestler in an amused voice.\n\nYou follow the instruction and get to your knees, you wriggle your knees slightly to get your trunks on your calves and then stand up kicking them off. The wrestler grabs them, picks them up and sniffs them.

As you know, a number of settlers and workers come in with money to purchase property, but this is limited to one-thousand credits and is enough to buy you a nice property. The only people who seem to not be satisfied with that amount are the corporate senior managers, but generally the corporations provide them with a penthouse in the corporate area at no cost to themselves. So, Miss Blake, if you wish to transfer anything over one-thousand credits into your private account there will be a verification checks.\n\nChecks? That does not sound good. You ask, &quot;So I need these checks if I want to buy a property, but what if I wanted to use my funds for spaceship repairs or something similar?&quot;\n\nThe clerk smiles again, &quot;Miss Blake that would not be a problem. Any transaction in the space quarter and the associated orbiting space docks is not considered a planetary transaction. Your New Terra account can be used if your spacecraft is damaged.&quot;\n\nThis would mean you could at least get the repairs done, but you’re still concerned about the checks. &quot;So what is involved in these 'checks' you mentioned earlier?&quot; you ask.\n\nThe clerk explains &quot;Details get entered into the planetary system to make sure they aren’t flagged for any reason.

The key points are:\n\n1. Sarah’s ex fiancé is known to not like monogamous relations, Sarah knew he cheated privately on her and he liked taking risks with public sex. Sarah reckons he would be up for cheating on Helen in her parent’s place\n\n2. You have invite for yourself + 1. So you can bring in some support, or you could hire an ‘escort’ to do the deed. \n\n3. You could go to the event really pushing the dress code, to make a scene as a good money grabbing Shebo girl should. Or you could dress for the event and play the mysterious girl.\n\n4. Between the pair of you, only two viable options come out. Either you or your accomplice will seduce the man, and then the other person will bring the occasion to the rest of the party goers. Or you could drug him, tie him up, inject his cock with an aphrodisiac so he stays erect which might make things easier. The downside is if he argues that he was drugged, you would need to frame it in such a way that makes his comments seem like little lies. \n\n5. Revenge, Helen is clearly a vindictive girl that holds a grudge. According to Sarah Thornton the whole grudge came about due to Sarah getting better grades than Helen, and some teenage romance. 15 years on and the grudge is still there. It would be clearly better that you are not directly involved, but could you let someone take the fall for your actions? \n\n6. Extra evidence, you would ideally need some other evidence of Paul, the fiancé being a shifty slimeball. This material could be released after the event to really cement the split, you are thinking of getting him to say a few things on camera that are derogatory to Helen. To do so it would help to sneak a camera in to the event. These events are notorious for good security stopping ‘tramps’ like you making an extra credit or two, getting blackmail material.  Can you sneak a micro camera past the security team? Otherwise you will have to revert to your optical implants recording capability which won’t produce the distanced wide angle footage you want.\n\n[[Decision time|MV1.1]]\n</div><div tiddler="CBA1A" tags="Stat_44" created="201507250931" modifier="twee" twine-position="1550,2110">When she feels you clench tighter but not move, she revs the chopper’s engine and takes off again.\n\nYou begin to get lost in a daze as you focus on enjoying the feelings from the seat. As you grind away against the nub, the realization that the people you’re passing may recognize you from the billboards sends your mind spiraling as your inhibitions slip away. You find yourself openly humping the seat like a bitch in heat as your arms now clinging desperately to the woman taking you for this ride. You feel a light shudder from her, but you are too lost in your own world to notice if it is from her own pleasure or just an insidious laugh.\n \nYou notice the bike slow to a crawls as you glance around and notice you have made your way to the city outskirts and are stuck trying to get on to the skyway. The goth girl jerkily humps the bike along as you continue to hump away yourself. You feel her elbow bump your side and look as she points her hand towards the smiling, amused faces of other bikers passing alongside you. When some start pointing at you, the humiliation only serves to turn you on further and you feel your panties become damper.\n\nYour breaking point is when she once more jerks the bike forward, sending a jolt through you as all of your muscles began to spasm. The vibrations of her engine only increase as she steadily pulls forward. You find your body matching the wails of the engine as you cry out in orgasm, your juices flooding through your jumpsuit and onto the seat this time. You are finally moving on the open road, but nothing matters to you anymore except for the vibrations between your legs to continue forever.\n\nYou are well past the city limits when you bother to look around again, but have no sense of direction for where you’ve ended up. The goth girl slows the bike down and takes a sharp turn onto patchy street in disrepair. The potholes on the road cause the chopper to buck wildly, like a wild animal trying to shake an attacker. The constant tossing causes the nub to come down hard between your thighs and you can feel your pussy lips begin to swell from the pounding.

You can guess what the bar is like, a load of greasers waiting for someone to use the toilets. You know the place though, most of the female glory girls are generally really pissed and wanting more alcohol, or depraved and kinky bitches up for a dare. Anyone who goes through with it can get the video, or get some beer vouchers which can be used at other venues.

Problem also is that you are dying for answers, trap or no trap you are going in. But first you need to finish this guy, no doubt she is watching the camera with great enjoyment.  It does not take long and the guy starts to spurt in your mouth before pulling it out, adding to the mess over your face and jumpsuit.

The training program he created is designed to break down normal moral and mental inhibitions that preventing exhibitionism, compulsive sex, emotional detachment, and the lack of guilt and remorse that are needed to become the perfect killing tool.\n\nAt the start of the game, Celeste has already become accustomed to the life of the party girl, leaving behind her a string of one night stands, sometimes with multiple partners, and has even taken part in orgies. She is sexually open-minded but as of yet lacks any real kinky edge.\n\nAs a killer, Celeste has only had to deal with insurgents, enemy combatants, and terrorists; targets generally seen as the ‘bad guys’.\n\nThe training gauge works as follows:\n\n1. Training starts at 20% due to Sid’s ongoing conditioning and reaches maximum efficiency at 100%.\n2. Training is not limited to 100% but going past the limit may result in a complete mental breakdown.\n3. Your training level may affect whether or not some choices become available in the game.\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Submissiveness&lt;/h3&gt;\nSid’s frustration with Celeste stems from her never joining his organization and choosing to remain a freelancer. This meant that she only undertook the infiltration missions she chose, which Sid saw as a waste of potential as she would make excellent assassin in his mind. Sid decided to use Celeste’s implants to encourage her to adopt a more submissive attitude with the ultimate goal of making her his willing slave and the perfect operative.\n\nIn game mechanics this means:\n1. When the gauge nears or reaches 100% a game ending will likely be triggered.\n2. Certain courses of action results in increased submission by small to great amounts.\n3. Your submission score will not increase the number of oppurtunities you have to be submissive, but may make it harder to resist certain situations.\n4. To finish the game Celeste //will// need to take submissive actions.

Maddock does not tell you his reasons, but just says it is imperative that access is regained to the facility.\n\nMaddock assembles a small team of mercenaries and his own people, and asks you to join him.  You refuse to join him, but help with the planning, with the number of Evictor’s on site, you think the chances of success are pretty slim, infiltration will be impossible now as well.  You wonder if Maddock is trying to get into the place for fame, or to follow through the plan himself.\n\nEither way you wish him luck, but don’t think you will see him again, the only good sense is that the cryptokey will be brought in with an explosive device, if Maddock dies then the key will be destroyed. The device is so powerful that the facility will be buried, at least, possibly badly damaged. Maddock assures you that troops are on there way, but mobilising forces takes time, and bureaucratic permission takes longer!\n\n[[Return to apartment|Apartment]]\n&lt;&lt;set $MadH to 5&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Mis8 is &quot;Complete&quot;&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Days +=2&gt;&gt;\n</div><div tiddler="FM4.5" tags="" created="201801031858" modifier="twee" twine-position="3510,6450">You escape the way you came back in, and join the extraction crews in the mine with your scientists in tow. It takes a few more hours to get out of the mine, eliminating a small mercenary crew sent to retrieve the scientists.  Good fortune shone on you there, no Evictors, just a lightweight crew who were more miners than soldiers. It then takes a few more hours to drive away from the location to dare making a call.  Any communication near the Xena facility would undoubtedly be scrutinised. \n\nMaddock’s team have already reviewed the footage and their faces are a combination of grim, and excited.  It is hard to tell whether this is mission accomplished and a great success for the team, or the start of something more sinister. The same thought occupies your mind, was the cryptokey you handed over the key for computer system you found in the core area?  Should you have brought it with you? You know in real terms it would have been stupid if you were captured, but should you have?  Too late now.\n\nOne thing you do know is where your life is headed, back to the military as they will be calling up all those with a military reservist obligation. The two scientists are quiet, contemplating their future as witnesses, will they end up up in the public spotlight, or at risk of attempts on their lives?  Probably not, unless the remaining Xena management managed to clear out all evidence, they are screwed. \n\n[[A day later|FM4.4]]</div><div tiddler="Lounge1A" tags="" created="201507041828" modifier="twee" twine-position="990,1270">You follow Giannio, a man who talks about himself and his work non-stop while motioning with his hands in exaggerated manner, into the elevator. After the hundredth time of him telling you how the name Giannio Dulcace is renowned through the fashion world, you start to wonder if the elevator will ever get to his floor.\n\nLuckily the elevator slows down and the doors open revealing a studio reception area. The room’s walls are made out of backlit frosted glass panels that seemingly to float in the air, the floors are made of white marble, and bold, designer furniture made out of shiny red plastic, chrome and more frosted glass compliment the aesthetic. Everything is crowned by the huge stylized signature ‘Giannio Dulcace’ above the double door entrance leading into the inner studio.\n\nGiannio directs his attention to the two personal assistants standing next to the reception desk who are clearly waiting for him. You gain some respect for him as he somehow managed to arrange to have the staff waiting for him during his constant babbling in the elevator.\n\nYou are led to the inner studio where you see that a number of dresses had been lined up for Giannio to choose from for you. They all look good to you, not that you have any say over the matter in any case. You just stand there smiling politely as you are wait to get a better look at his assistants who are notably dividing their attention between you and Giannio.\n\nOne is a thin, androgynous looking male in his late twenties, Giannio’s boy toy no doubt, and the other is an attractive female of mixed oriental descent who appears to be in her early twenties and is wearing a form flattering dress. She is now intently watching you and gives you an inviting smile. You aren’t sure if this is part of the standard client relations or if she is showing you genuine, personal interest.\n\nYour thoughts are interrupted when Giannio declares &quot;Ahh, here we go!&quot;\n\n[[Watch the excited man|Lounge1B]]</div><div tiddler="Lounge1C" tags="" created="201507041920" modifier="twee" twine-position="1270,1270">The platform stops spinning and as you step off the platform. Giannio says, &quot;I was right, darling. You are perfect fit for the dress!&quot;\n\nYou move over to the design table with the dress draped over it and reach over to try it on. Giannio immediately speaks up and says, &quot;Celeste, darling. Let Lina help you with that. It is what she gets paid for, love.&quot;\n\nLina snorts, &quot;You mean my father pays you to let me work for you.&quot;\n\nGiannio laughs, &quot;Lina, darling, sometimes you like to play the part of the lowly assistant.&quot;\n\n&quot;Not today, //darling//. Today I am Lina Chung, daughter of Hu Chung,&quot; Lina says. You have no idea who Hu Chung is but it was clear that Lina has power over Giannio whenever she wishes so.\n\nLina steps over to you and asks you to raise your hands. With the help of a step stool she gets the dress on you, her hands often touching your breasts and lightly brushing over your now erect nipples as she does. Meanwhile, Giannio is busy talking to his other assistant seemingly, oblivious to all that was happening. Lina pulls the dress down over your body, giving you a very slow and sensual caress as she does, and finally pulls the dress down to your thighs.\n \nGiannio looks over at you and claps. &quot;Marvelous! Simply marvelous, darling! You will make heads turn and everybody will see the brilliance of Giannio,&quot; he boasts. &quot;Oh, I must call James. He is my favourite photographer,&quot; he says as he rushes with his scarf trailing behind him. You are slightly amused by the sour look the male assistant throws at the mention of the photographer.\n\n&quot;Just one last thing, dear. You need to change into your new panties,&quot; Lina whispers in your ear.\n\n[[Stand still and let Lina take off your panties.

It is hard to keep a low profile in the station as there are few people on it. There is a train just about to leave and if you made a sprint towards it you could probably get away. However, the Security Officer would probably spot you and if he recognized you then he would call in back-up. Would backup arrive at the next stop, would they stop the train, or would the Security Officer just think you are a commuter who is in a rush? The biggest problem is you are wearing the same jumpsuit.\n\nYou could decide to try and make amends with the Security Officer and butter him up. It galls you to consider this option, but after you calmed down from last time you realized there is some benefit in building bridges. The fun seeking side of you thinks that if you are going to run for it, you might as well announce yourself and make it a game of 'kiss chase' with adult consequences.\n\n\n[[Make a run for it and announce yourself|Random RL2A]]\n[[Make amends with the security officer|Random RL2B]]</div><div tiddler="Random RL5" tags="" created="201505032231" modifier="twee" twine-position="5610,4910">You once again see the security officer that you gave the blowjob to.

Lina steps off the step stool and lifts the hem of your dress above your waist so that your panties are visible then walks around and kneels in front of you. She looks up at your face and then lowers her gaze down between your legs.\n\nHer face inches away from your crotch, she reaches up to grab the sides of your panties and slowly and gently tugs them downwards revealing your sex. With no resistance from you, she continues to pull them all the way down and you step out of the panties.\n\nShe looks up at you and slowly and provocatively pokes her tongue out with an impish gleam in her eyes, her face just a hand’s breadth away from you lower lips.\n\n[[Call her bluff and grab ahold of Lina’s head|Lounge1F]]  \n[[Ignore her teasing and step away to put on Lina’s panties|Lounge1E]]</div><div tiddler="Random RL7" tags="" created="201505032308" modifier="twee" twine-position="5610,5190">Do you make contact with the security officer after he left you his phone number?\n\n[[Yes|Random RL7B]]\n[[No|Random RL7A]]</div><div tiddler="Random RL6" tags="" created="201505032232" modifier="twee" twine-position="5610,5050">After a couple more close runs you are really beginning to enjoy travelling on the metro line. Knowing that the security officers are actively looking for you gives you such a thrill. This time however the station is empty and sneaking around is a lot more difficult to manage. You then notice a CCTV camera following your movements and assume the worst. Looking behind you, you can see two security officers approaching and you hurriedly take a side exit. As soon as you are out of sight you start to run but the whirl of a moving CCTV camera says they are on to you. You are closing in on one of the secondary exits when you round the corner and find the door has been closed. A repeating, robotic voice says the door has been closed for maintenance and to please use an alternative entrance or exit point. \n\nA person cussing on the other side gives the game away; the door has just been sealed closed.  Now that you have been trapped like a rat, you turn around and start walking back to the main station platform asking yourself whether you will fight or surrender. As you round the corner the decision has basically been made for you. The two security officers have been joined by three more and they have closed the entrance to the station, effectively locking you in. One of the guards has a supervisor’s rank slide on his uniform and he speaks up. \n\n&quot;Well, Miss, I hear you assaulted one of my men, though he did admit to touching you up a wee bit. You have also led my men on a merry chase, flaunting your body as you do, I might add. Now that chase is up and you are caught, what are you going to do?&quot; he asks with a harsh tone.\n\n[[Tell them you'll do anything they ask|Random RL6A]]\n[[Fight back|Random RL6B]]</div><div tiddler="CBD3" tags="Stat_19" created="201508272126" modifier="twee" twine-position="3370,2110">Misty puts on a good show, but there is one question you can't get out of your mind.\n\n&lt;img src=data/lushy.gif&gt;\n\n//&quot;Could that be me, someday?&quot;// you wonder as you watch her thrust the big, fat dildo into her wet pussy. &quot;//What would it be like to fo that in front of a stranger?&quot;//\n\nYou know Misty is turned on by the act since after a few routines, she climbs onto your chair and lets you lick her out until she comes twice.

You can always tell yourself you thought it was part of the test, right? Such gentle touches only take you so far, and you quickly start to use your fingernails, digging in hard and leaving red lines all over yourself. \n\nSqueezing a nipple hard, you hiss with pain and pleasure as you rock your hips a little. The movement brings fresh jolts of pain from the bench below and this time you don't mind at all. Parting your thighs wide, you lean forwards and back, grinding yourself against the harsh steel and it’s little, round teeth. The sensation is exquisite, but it's not quite hitting the spot anymore. You've quickly gone from trying to avoid the painto trying to make yourself feel more of it as intimately as possible. To do that, though, it needs better access.\n\nRaising yourself up halfway for a moment, you part your thighs as widely as you can without moving your hips from the bench. You then spread yourself with both hands, lean right down between your knees, and lower yourself back onto the bench. Sharp metal scratches your lips, the backs of your thighs, and the sides of your finger as you ease your weight onto it. Once you feel your clit is right on top of a ring of upraised teeth, you inhale then press your full weight down on it. \n\n&quot;Oh, fuck,&quot; you hear yourself say. &quot;Hurt me just like that.&quot; \n\nTalking to inanimate objects is probably a bad sign, but you can't help it as your body opens up and floods with arousal. You lean back further until the pressure decreases, then forwards againto max it out. You repeat this cycle and there is no need for your hands to get involved, and you return them to your breasts. You claw at the sensitive tissue and twist your nipples.\n\nYou feel like you’re on fire and droplets of sweat run down your body as you rock your clit back and forth on the steel, making it sore and driving yourself wild. You suddenly realize there is only thing that could make this any better... an audience. You lift your eyes to the panel opposite of you and hope it is a window and there are people there watching. You picture them enjoying the sight of you getting yourself off on pain from their wonderfully nasty bench.\n\n[[Slow down and collect yourself|KS1.9]]\n[[Finish what you're doing|KS1.8]]</div><div tiddler="Mission 7" tags="" created="201504091158" modifier="twee" twine-position="10,5890">&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;\n  &lt;div class=&quot;sheet&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Saving Sarah&lt;/h1&gt;\n      &lt;table&gt;\n        &lt;thead&gt;\n          &lt;tr&gt;\n            &lt;th colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;\n          &lt;/tr&gt; \n        &lt;/thead&gt;\n        &lt;tbody&gt;\n          &lt;tr&gt;\n            &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Your mission is to rescue the daughter of Geoff Tranter from the clutches of the Delta Cartel.

Curiosity makes you resume the video and you are soon confronted with someone in a cleaner’s uniform on the floor and a barrack room of Evictor mercenaries crowding around her.\n\nYou realize this must be this 'attractive cleaner' on her back, on top of a table, with an Evictor thrusting between her spread legs. The camera moves closer and you note that she is a short, petite blond and looks very familiar. You can't see the woman’s face as the camera is angled towards the Evictor who is banging her roughly. When the camera does swing around, a cold chill runs through you.\n\n&quot;Oh my goodness,&quot; you say in shock. &quot;That’s Claire!&quot;\n\nClearly Maddock sent Claire in here first and she failed the mission and earned the unfortunate privilege of being gangbanged by a whole load of Evictor mercenaries. You watch on in a mixture of rage and arousal; fifty studs having their way with you is quite a challenge. \n\nYou get wetter watching the video and your hand moves to your groin causing you to give a moan of frustration. You watch a little more before brining yourself to your senses as you try and repress your lustful thoughts. Your fate would be more than a little unpleasant if you were caught by the Evictor Commander rubbing yourself off.\n\nYou want release and an idea comes into your head: You could strip off, enter the slave cell with the video, give yourself a good fingering, and when the Commander arrives cuff yourself up. You don't think on this long and soon the cleaner’s uniform is hidden away. You open the cell and enter, rubbing your thighs together as you go.\n\n[[You need some relief|MRC2]]</div><div tiddler="Mission 9 Start" tags="" created="201507251821" modifier="twee" twine-position="10,6730">You spend a lot of time with Benz and his associates in planning out the strike. The plan is quite simple, kill the Delta Cartel’s ‘Spymaster’ and the Head of the Dragon Gang. The ‘Spymaster’ is Delta’s strongest asset who basically act’s as their head of intelligence, losing this elusive player will seriously weaken the Cartel. As for the Dragon Gang eliminating their leader will start a leadership battle, a battle that will be interesting as there is no clear favourite.  The current position is that the Dragon Gang have been giving the Delta Cartel a hard time, and if the Dragon Gang are in disarray the Cartel will strike back escalating the war. The Aruba Syndicate are playing the long game and aim to get corporate support as the easiest to deal with and take the position currently tenuously held by Delta. \n\nWith the Dragon Gang leader there are two options, you could infiltrate in armed to the teeth and look to kill him, or Aruba could get you in as a hostess, where you should get an opportunity to get free and take him out. Hostesses are used as tables for sushi, ornaments or other entertainment. The Aruba people outline this as an option, not knowing if it would insult your pride but that option would mean less of a firefight. &lt;&lt;if $Intel17 is &quot;Complete&quot;&gt;&gt;It occurs to you that Lina's dad is a 'business owner' associated with the Dragon Gang, and that Lina's Grandfather was the head of the Dragon Gang, before the current leader. You keep this to yourself.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $Lina &gt;=2&gt;&gt;The other thing is could you help Lina become the Dragon Gang Leader? You are not sure, but it is worth thinking about.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n\nThe Spymaster is problematic as he is adept at keeping his location secret and all you have to go on is that Aruba Syndicate have a tip off that later on today the Spymaster is visiting a Delta Cartel joint. You agree a simple plan with Aruba that you infiltrate the joint as a customer and will slip into the back office, risky but otherwise tracking down the elusive quarry could take months. Even a normal infiltration takes a few days planning and surveillance beforehand. The joint is basically a large bar and club. \n\nYou head back to your apartment and get changed into your clubbing gear and after waiting a few hours you head off down to the Delta joint to test your luck against the Spymaster………&lt;&lt;if $Weapon1 is 1&gt;&gt;You have the fingernail blades that will allow you to defend yourself if needed. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $Weapon2 is 1&gt;&gt;You have the polymer flick knife stashed in your boot&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n\n[[To meet the Spymaster?|CL1.1]]\n</div><div tiddler="KS1.9" tags="" created="201510310759" modifier="twee" twine-position="2250,2810">Suppressing your desires, you hear a beep from a nearby door.

You're already through it when you feel the scratches on your knuckles, the palm of your other hand, your thighs, and your ass from jumping up like that.\n\nThis mission, whatever it is, had better pay well. Straightening your legs, you get a look around at the new room. &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;KS1.7&quot;)&gt;&gt;Your first thought is to check for threats, followed by the urge to find somewhere you can finish masturbating.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You quickly scan the room looking for threats and anything else of interest.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; You see no threats or much else, except for three more doors. Two are locked interior doors and the third stands open, inviting you into a shower.\n\nIt is, you see once you're in it, quite the luxurious shower. There are six adjustable shower-heads above you and eleven body jets around the side walls of a large enclosure. You stare at it and think about how it could hold three comfortably or maybe nine if they wanted to get really close together under the hot spray, foamy shampoo suds pooling between their chests where they pressed together.\n\nYou picture these imaginary shower guests splashing their arms as they washed each other's hair, faces, shoulders, necks, breasts and bodies. They’d squirm against each other, kissing in the steamy air, pressed grointo hips and grointo groin. They’d licked the moisture from behind each other's ears, running their water-lubricated hands all over each other's bodies. Their fingers pressed just there, touched... stroked ... caressed... rubbed... just... like... //THAT//!\n\nSlowly, you lift your face and your right shoulder off the shower base. Water dribbles from your lips and nose and streams down your hair. Oh, yes, you found a place to &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;KS1.7&quot;)&gt;&gt;finish masturbating&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;masturbate&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; alright. The shower keeps pouring over you as you revel in the floaty feeling of all that fire having been blown out of you. Maybe this mission doesn't have to pay so well after all. If it's all going to be like this, it'll pay well enough. \n\nLooking around at the marvelous shower, you notice that the pipes behind the body jets are visible within the walls and that the walls are transparent. You're in a well-lit space, surrounded by windows with dark rooms beyond them, naked and kneeling with your knees wide apart and your hands at your sides. You let anyone who's in there watch the water sheet down over your skin and make no effort at all to cover yourself. They all just saw you cum and the fact that you're letting them look you over at their leisure, holding this submissive pose, is making you horny again.\n\n[[Give them a show|KS1.11]]\n[[Stand up, rinse off, and get out|KS1.10]]</div><div tiddler="Throne 1" tags="" created="201511152137" modifier="twee" twine-position="1410,3930">&lt;img src=data/throne0.png&gt;\n\nCaroline smiles at you as she locks the shackles in place.

You use your hands grip the bars and attempt to alternate the brunt of the stress between your leg and arm muscles to stop them from cramping.\n\nThe feeling of uncomfortable pressure between your legs is a constant reminder of the hook in your pussy; you are just thankful that the wire is still slack.

She runs a constant dialogue with Shaun as you caress her breasts, nipples, inner thighs and other erogenous zones. \n\nSlowly and sensually you move down to her inner thighs and tease her pussy mound, then her inner lips, before slipping a finger into her damp hole. Carla starts giving you directions on various fingering techniques before telling you to go down on her. As you start licking her out, she keeps up the dialogue and Shaun watches rapt with attention while stroking his erect member.\n\nCarla starts to purr with excitement and desire as her words becomes broken up with comments such as, &quot;R-right th-there.&quot; as she pants and moans more. Suddenly she shouts, &quot;Shaun, you can fuck Celeste in her slutty pussy&quot;. With Carla's juices running over your chin and your tongue flicking her clit, you simply carry on with more enthusiasm; after all, your pussy //is// aching for some attention.\n\nShaun happily complies and he roughly thrusts two of his fingers into your pussy. They slide right in, so with a bit of fumbling he lines up his knob and rams it inside of you. He carries on like a bucking bronco, banging you doggy style, mashing your face into Carla's pussy. His enforced pussy bashing of brings her to a climax and Shaun soon ejaculates inside of you, leaving you the only one without an orgasm.\n\nAs Carla starts to come down from her orgasm she smiles and says, &quot;Now you see what the problem is, he doesn't last long. Celeste, I want you to lie on the bed and let Shaun fuck you missionary style. I'm going to hold his hips and make him pace himself.&quot; Again you comply, hoping that this time your aching pussy will get the attention it wants. \n\nIt soon becomes apparent to you that Carla is playing a game. She is slowing Shaun down and making sure that he rubs the right spots, but as you start to come close to orgasm, she stops him from finishing you off. As a final point, when Shaun does orgasm a second time, she pulls Shaun out so his semen covers your belly and pubic hair.\n\n&quot;Shaun, try licking out Celeste while I go and get something,&quot; she orders with a devious grin.\n\nShaun complies and starts eagerly eating you out. You reach down and pull his head in, hoping to get the orgasm you have been denied. A few moments pass and Shaun is pulled off you by Carla who is now wearing a big strap-on. \n\n&quot;Celeste, roll over and onto your knees like a good girl,&quot; she commands. You follow the instructions and roll over onto your belly and get on all fours.\n\nCarla wastes no time and slips the strap-on dildo into your wet pussy and starts to roughly bang you. Rough sex has turned you on for some time now and as your pleasure builds you start to groan loudly.\n\n&quot;Shaun, Celeste wants your dick in her mouth,&quot; Carla says with a laugh. \n\nWithout hesitation, he climbs onto the bed with his cock bouncing towards your mouth. You accept his member and wrap your lips around it as Carla continues to bang you, sometimes choking you on Shaun’s member. It doesn't take long and you feel your pussy clench the dildo as you have an intense, body-shaking orgasm.\n\nCarla lets out a little triumphant, &quot;Yes,&quot; and pulls out of you. &quot;Shaun, come and taste Celeste juices,&quot; she says as she offer the dildo for him to suck. Shaun, to his credit, does not do it, but you have no doubt that before long Carla will have trained him. Carla, irritated, pulls your head off Shaun’s cock which you were starting to focus more attention. &quot;No more of that, Shaun,&quot; Carla snorts. Shaun pulls away and says nothing in response. After things cool down, Shaun goes to get a shower and at Carla's suggestion you two chat.\n\n&quot;Celeste, I know you are a strong girl, but I can tell you enjoy being submissive sometimes too,&quot; she starts and you nod in agreement. &quot;I can make it up to you.

Unseen your plan is to wait for the party to kick in and the guards to become complacent and bored. When the guests go, you will strike.\n\nThe time goes by slowly but you feel relaxed with the weapons at your side. There are 10 guards upstairs, a small reaction team with half decent weapons while the others are little more than bouncers, to keep the guests from straying where they are not wanted. At the end of the party you watch with interest as the high ranking gang members head upstairs with a collection of girls. The party ends and the after party starts.\n\nYou reckon you could take out the 10 guards quickly and quietly and that would leave you with several options:\n\n[[Break into the after party and shoot everyone|CL2.1A]]\n\n[[Break into the after party and challenge the Dragon Gang leader to a duel|CL2.1B]]\n</div><div tiddler="Mission1.5A" tags="" created="201511032207" modifier="twee" twine-position="3510,10">Using the Magnum's communications system, you open an encrypted channel to Sid. After a while Sid's image appears before you on screen and you outline what had happened. Sid takes a moment to digest the information you have just given him before responding.\n\n&quot;Ok. Well, what matters is that you're alive and the mission can still be completed when you get the data off planet. I'm very surprised to hear about Hugo though. That data core is heavily encrypted and my client should be the only one with the decryption key. Either the insider agent is playing off two separate corporations or the client has their own leak.\n\n&quot;I will make a few enquiries and speak with the client. My personal advice is to upload the data core and book yourself a commercial flight off the planet. Your reward will cover the loss of your ship and you can just work directly for me to keep yourself in the clear.&quot;\n\n&quot;Somehow I knew you were going to say that Sid. I have no problems uploading the data, but Jane and I are a team,&quot; you declare, your face clearly full of anger. &quot;While I don't care much about the ship, apart from it helping me freelance, Jane is a dear friend and I'm not abandoning her. You also know I am not interested in working for you directly. So, if you want either of us to carry out your missions in the future, that robotic brain of yours better come up with some ideas. Am I //absolutely// clear?&quot;\n\n&quot;So much for the easy way then, I guess,&quot; Sid relents with an agitated sigh. &quot;Well, in that case I suggest that you contact Max Grayson. Max is the main information broker in the city and I can set up an appointment for you. He also owes me a few favors and knows people who can get you into the right circles. You can totally trust Max, well, trust him as much as you can trust anyone in our line of work. He will know what happened and probably knows a few details about you as well. \n\n&quot;Secondly, don't transfer money from your off-planet accounts. All transactions are monitored and any money transfers exceeding one-thousand credits to your local account will raise red flags. You're there on a commercial visa and any suspicious financial activity will betray your cover, although local money transfers are fine and less scrutinized. Speaking of which, I'll transfer one-thousand credits over to you once you give me the details of your local account.\n\n&quot;Thirdly, we need to talk about your tech. Only corporations and off-worlders have access to the gear you possess. The gangs sometimes get ahold of the hi-tech stuff but the gear and its owners are hunted down by the corporations. Taking on high visibility jobs using your current kit is tantamount to suicide.\n\n&quot;Lastly, a lot of Evindium is not very keen on outsiders and you don't have a reputation or local contacts to fall back on in the area, so be very careful. Be prepared to take on some distasteful jobs while you’re here. I'll arrange an apartment in the Space Quarter for you so you won't draw unwanted attention to the ship. You can upload the data core from a terminal in the apartment. Good luck,&quot; he says then cuts the transmission.\n\nYou look over to Jane who seems uneasy. She likely overheard a good chunk of the conversation between you and Sid.\n\n&quot;You know, leaving me behind might be the best option. I could find some work downtown. Maybe even start a family and live a life here...&quot; she trails off solemnly.\n\n&quot;We are in this together and I promise to do anything required to get us out here,&quot; you boast, trying to cheer her up. &quot;Whatever it takes. I swear, Jane.&quot;\n\n&quot;Whatever it takes... You promise?&quot; Jane asks looking up.\n\n&quot;//Anything at all//. We are a team,&quot; you say while giving her a reassuring smile. &quot;I've got to get going though. Sid promised to sort out an apartment for me in the Space Quarter and he set me up with a few leads. I'll call you to let you know what's going on once I get settled in. \n\n&quot;You hang tight on the Magnum, and Jane, if you see anything suspicious, use the ship to escape and ditch it downtown. You are more important to me than the ship, do you understand?&quot; you ask with a determined look in your eyes.\n\n&quot;Kind of, though I wish Hugo didn't double cross us. I think his 'stamina' would have kept me from getting bored!&quot; she admits with a growing smile.\n\n&quot;Hah, that's the spirit. When we get off planet we will go partying for a week! As for Hugo, I wouldn't worry, your fingers will never let you down,&quot; Celeste adds with a wink. &quot;If it gets too bad, I might even be able to pick up a toy for you in the Red Light District.

As fair a sight as you both may be, I have to wonder what this mission is all about.

As you can probably guess, [[Sid]] hasn’t told me shit about this Op,&quot; Hugo says while giving them his best flirtatious look and smile he can muster. He gets a brief sense of satisfaction as both women smile back and Jane turns her face slightly away.\n\n&quot;Come on, Hugo,&quot; you scold him, holding his gaze. &quot;You are being paid a hefty sum to be professional and wait for the mission briefing. I appreciate you giving us your best puppy dog eyes and all I’ll say is you’ll probably end up doing nothing more than standing around in your armour looking pretty.&quot;\n\n&quot;Wow,&quot; Hugo says with a snort. &quot;I just have the best luck! How about a quick threesome before the hangar security shows up?&quot;\n\n&quot;You’re pushing your luck, Hugo. There is friendly banter and then there is being unprofessional. Besides, even if I did fancy you, I don’t normally mix business with pleasure,&quot; you explain. With that last comment, you walk past Hugo and start to operate the rear cargo door.\n\n&quot;So there’s no hope for me?&quot; Hugo shouts with a mock sadness, as he stands from his seat and looks to Jane. \n\nYou look over his shoulder and make eye contact with Jane.\n\n[[Wink at her|Hangar1][$ProWink to 1]]\n[[Roll your eyes at his comments|Hangar1]]</div><div tiddler="Sarah" tags="" created="201711191613" modifier="twee" twine-position="3370,150">&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=data/saraht2.png&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=data/saraht.png&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;\n\nSarah - A tough girl you rescued and then recruited.

You try your comms chip for a signal but realize you are so deep underground that it is unable to get a signal. The guards notice your split second indecision and you are suddenly thrown forwards and you land face first on the mattress. As you roll over and move to get up, four men enter the room. You lie on your back looking at them, thighs slightly apart on the stained mattress. Out of the corner of your eye you notice a chain attached to a solid bolt in the wall and ends in a neck shackle and wonder if you will end up wearing it.\n \n&quot;We are going to fuck you silly, miss,&quot; one of the guards says with a smile. &quot;Do you want to be tied up or are you just going to spread those legs nice and easy for us?&quot;\n \n&quot;I think she will like it better with her hands cuffed behind her back, while she is forced to eat the mattress as we fuck her doggy style,&quot; says another guard with a laugh.\n \n&quot;We could sell her as well.

It is common for the winners to reveal their identities after the match but there were some who continued to use their alter ego, never revealing themselves. All anonymous fighters wore masks and some even chose to use customized virtual reality skin overlays to ensure no one could discover who they were.\n\nOut of curiosity, you ask if someone could impersonate another fighter by using the same pseudonym.

As you get closer, it is clear that he has noticed the pistols straight as his eyes get wider.\n\n&quot;D-Did you actually kill her?&quot; he asks, clearly shocked.\n\n&quot;No. I only managed to disarm her,&quot; you reply, appraising the man as you do.\n\n&quot;Where was she? It is time those damn hunters get some payback,&quot; he eagerly declares.\n\nYou give a brief description of where you left her and the man sets off in that general direction. You have no interest in seeing what happens next and tell the man that you hope any justice is delivered quickly. You are not sure if the man gets what you mean but why should you care?  The bitch clearly enjoys hunting down people and murdering them; a violent end would be well deserved.\n\nThe rest of your trek through the tunnels is uneventful. At one point, you come spot another contestant in the distance, let off a few rounds, but ultimately because they reacted quickly. You wonder how the show’s management will try to get the guns off of you. When you reach the exit for the tunnels, a contestant visibly flinches when she sees the gun. You’re both not allowed to speak but it is clear she wants to know if you killed Shadow Viper. No-one from the show’s management comes out to retrieve the weapon and you both take a seat in a booth to watching the video feeds of the tunnels.\n\nOne video feed shows an unconscious Shadow Viper as the contestant you ran into approaches her. She is rudely awakened by the man smashing her head into the floor and then strangling her. Once her body gives, the corpse is dragged into a drainage duct and dropped into make recovering the body difficult. She’ll likely end up food for the roaches and rats that litter places like these. \n\nThe man who killed Shadow Viper is the last to arrive and gives you a nod makes a throat cutting gesture as he comes in. As you and the other contestants gather together, they all take in the pistols next to you and work out what has happened. When you are all called in for the next round a couple of armed show security staff take the weapons off you, saying nothing else. The $Contestants remaining contestants are split up and individually taken by vehicle to the starting points of the next challenge; the sniper alley. You hope she isn’t feeling too arrogant because you have a little surprise coming her way.\n\n[[Time to keep going|RTG3][$Hunters -= 1]]</div><div tiddler="MV4.4" tags="" created="201704162250" modifier="twee" twine-position="2810,4910">With Paul drugged and the audience all entertained with the hooker you get Paul off into one of the bedrooms and dressed in a latex suit and zip up gimp mask, you then cuff him to the bed and get his cock out. With his cock out you apply the aphrodisiac and tell Paul you will be back for the best sex ever.\n\nWith Paul waiting you head off to the room where the hooker went and find her sucking one of the men off, part way through working her way through the men. You quickly tell them that you need the girl to play a prank on someone. Remembering Sarah, they all agree, even the guy getting the blowjob. You ask them to sort themselves out and get everyone, especially Helen. The blokes head off and the hooker starts talking about a raise for all this extra work. You tell her that she will get loads of publicity with this guy, you then tell her that she needs to ride the gimp cuffed to the bed, and to get him to talk really dirty. When he cums she is allowed to unzip the gimp mask to the audience. The girl agrees and guesses that the gimp mask restricts the man’s vision and hearing, so he won’t know how big the audience is. You tell her that she is right, but neglect to mention the drugs in Paul’s bloodstream. \n\nAs you head off, the party management have turned on a security camera system and are showing the bedroom with Paul, full on hardon straining in his bonds. This is in the main party area and people are getting ready for the reveal, to find out who has been stitched up in this way. The hooker walks-in and after a bit of teasing with her mouth and pussy starts riding Paul. She starts to get into the swing of things when she finds Paul willing to shout that she is the best, and then do all sorts of things like beg, and snort like a pig.\n\nThe audience laughs at the hooker making the drunken idiot say and do silly things and you enjoy watching Helen. First she appeared indifferent, slightly interested in who it was, but the more Paul spoke, voice muffled by the mask the more worried she looked. You can see her now, looking around for Paul and has sent one of her flunkies out looking for Paul. You can’t resist waiting though, feeling almost orgasmically happy how this is turning out. When Paul does cum and the mask is pulled off, you feel a great surge of excitement as you hear Helen scream and the shocked gasp from the audience, then the amused laugher as Helen storms off. You quickly leave, feeling that you have achieved the best humiliation ever.\n\nAs you leave the complex your jubilation goes downhill after you hear a scream, and looking up you see what seems to be a naked girl trying to hold onto a balcony while someone hits her. With a sinking feeling you suspect that this is the hooker, about to be launched off a 30-storey building. This quickly brings you down to a true cold hearted mission head and you flag a taxi and head off.\n\n[[Mission Accomplished|Mission 4 Debrief][$M4outcome to 4]]\n\n</div><div tiddler="MRC1" tags="" created="201507072223" modifier="twee" twine-position="2810,5750">This part of the mission goes well and you find the security room unoccupied. Your concerns with your pass are relieved as you find a Master Access Keycard lying by the console, which you quickly snatch.\n\nAll then goes very smoothly and you find yourself in the Commander’s office. You locate the computer mainframe and insert the hacking device. Once it finishes you toss the data core in the waste disposal chute. There is one problem is the other part of your mission was to assassinate the Evictor Commander and you are out in the open without a plan.\n\nLooking around the room for options, you notice a requisition order for a slave girl for the commander. This order had been accepted and a delivery date is listed as expected today or tomorrow. Chuckling to yourself as you reading through the Commander’s preferences, you see he has requested a disobedient amazon.\n\nYou find the slave girl cell next to the Commander’s bedroom with a basic mattress and a number of bondage items. The most useful thing you note are a set of magnetic cuffs with a key sequence listed. Knowing the key sequence means that you can open these cuffs yourself and from this an idea springs into your head. You could cuff yourself up naked in this sealed cell and wait for the Commander. When he arrives you can release the cuffs at the right moment and assassinate him.\n\n[[Leave knowing you have completed part of your mission|MRC1A]]\n[[Strip naked, hide your cleaner’s gear, and cuff yourself in the closet|MRC2]]</div><div tiddler="MRC2" tags="" created="201507082318" modifier="twee" twine-position="3090,5750">As you enter the closet you realize that it is soundproofed and that you will have no way of knowing when the Commander gets back&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;MRC1A&quot;)&gt;&gt; so you abandon the idea of finding relief&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;. You cuff yourself and make sure that you can lock and unlock the cuffs beforehand. Once you are cuffed, you try it againto be on the safe side, and the release code works. You lock them one final time then wait for the Commander to arrive.\n\nAfter you start to feel a little uncomfortable, a video starts playing on the screen mounted in the door. &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;MRC1A&quot;)&gt;&gt;You decided not to take in the video of Claire as soon as you realized that the room was soundproofed, but it looks like the Commander is in attendance and is playing the video to try and get you worked up.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You assume the Commander has arrived and has put this on to turn you on. The video starts with someone in a cleaner’s uniform on the floor and a barrack room of Evictor mercenaries crowding around her.\n\nThe attractive cleaner is on her back, on top of a table, with an Evictor thrusting between her spread legs. The camera moves closer and you note that she is a short, petite blond and looks very familiar. You can't see the woman’s face as the camera is angled towards the Evictor who is banging her roughly. When the camera does swing around, a cold chill runs through you.\n\n&quot;Oh my goodness,&quot; you say in shock. &quot;That’s Claire!&quot;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\n\nThe video goes on for over an hour and you have to battle to keep your emotions in check. Arousal, anger, and a tinge of fear all flow through you. Eventually the door opens and a naked, muscular man stands in front of you.\n\n&quot;This is what happens to good looking girls who stray into the barracks,&quot; he warns you with an evil grin. &quot;You will want to be sure to keep me satisfied.&quot;\n\n[[Give him a defiant look|MRC3]]</div><div tiddler="MRC3" tags="" created="201510112002" modifier="twee" twine-position="3230,5750">&quot;I am pleased. I wasn’t expecting a good specimen for weeks but someone has found me an angry looking Amazonian to fuck. Alas, I am infertile, but if I wasn’t I’d gladly knock you up,&quot; he says with a sneer.\n\nAgain you say nothing and stay sat on the floor with your knees to your chest, deliberately hiding your tits and pussy from the man. \n\n&quot;Show yourself to me,&quot; he orders. &quot;Stand up and give me a slow twirl or I will make you,&quot; the Commander states, an expectant gleam in his eye.\n\nYou’re familiar with magnetic cuffs and you know this cell is adapted to their use. Any prisoner would know that so you play the part and get up in a dejected, but defiant, manner. You give him a dirty look and twirling far too quickly for him to have a real look at your body.\n\n&quot;Position A,&quot; barks the Evictor Commander and the computer system responds to the command. The cuffs on your wrists and ankles start to move, pulling you into the position. When the cuffs stop, you find yourself facing towards the man with your legs spread apart and your arms pointing towards the ceiling. \n\n&quot;Bastard!&quot; you yell. \n\nThe Evictor chuckles and starts walking around you, squeezing your flesh, and inspecting your musculature. Finally he stops and addresses you again.\n\n&quot;You really are the perfect specimen for my request. I will enjoy using you,&quot; he says as his hand reaches between your spread legs where he finds you a little moist. This is followed by a burrowing finger, which slips in quite easily, and then comes out. He takes the wet finger and wipes it across your cheek as you turn your head sideways in defiance.\n\n&quot;You are truly an interesting one. I see your lust outweighs your fear and I find that //very// erotic,&quot; comes his gravelly voice.\n\nYou glance over at the man then turn away unsure.\n\n&quot;I think it’s only appropriate that I fuck a hard bitch like you doggy style,&quot; he pauses to let his words sink in. &quot;The question I have to ask is: Will you adopt the position like a little slut or will I have to force you?&quot;\n\n&quot;Position 0!&quot; he shouts and your arms resting on the static gauntlets fall slightly until you regain control. You drop your arms to your sides while stepping forward. You stand there, acutely aware of your pussy getting wetter by the moment.\n\n[[Get down on your hands and knees|MRC3A]]\n[[Tell him to try and make you|MRC3B]]</div><div tiddler="MRC4" tags="" created="201512062201" modifier="twee" twine-position="3650,5750">One of your problems with this slave cell is that is soundproof. The Evictor Commander, in his arrogance, has left the door open and you can hear him moving about in the room. When a sliding door clangs shut you make your move and remove the cuffs.\n\nYou quickly dart out of the cell and pick up the sword you saw earlier. It is designed to cut through armour and will make short work of the naked Commander. It is a slight gamble in going through the side door, but your earlier exploration revealed a small side room between the bedroom and bathroom.\n\nSummoning up your resolve, you head through the door and find yourself in the Commander’s bedroom where he is still naked and holding a towel. When he sees you his eyes widen in shock but he quickly regains his composure and heads for his armour closet, not doubt to grab a firearm. To his credit he does, manage to open it and get his hands on a pistol but by that time your borrowed sword has split his head open in two.\n\nYou quickly jump in the shower and wash the blood and cum from your body, careful not to linger as you clean your pussy. You dry yourself and head back out and don the cleaners outfit. This time you grab a pistol to deal with the guards outside the Commander’s Office. The pistol is a silenced weapon and the security camera point away from the guard. You assume that stereotypical guard mentality will make him question why you have been in the Commander's Office for so long.\n \nAs you exit the Commander’s office, the guard stands at attention and then visibly relaxes when he sees that it is you. He raises his hand to stop you and you bring the concealed pistol up and shoot him point blank in the face. With the guard taken care of, you leave the pistol on the dead body and walk off at a cleaner’s normal speed.\n\nYou exit the same way you came in and meet Claire at the agreed rendezvous location.\n\n[[Mission Debrief|Mission 6 Debrief]]</div><div tiddler="MV4.1" tags="" created="201704161022" modifier="twee" twine-position="2250,4910">You decide to cut to the chase and make a crude offer to the already slightly drunk men. You offer your hooker to anyone who can handle 10 shots of your choosing, and of course you will join in. This brings out a load of comments from how many more to get you, and that neither of //you girls// will be standing. \n\nYou then challenge the men that you can outdrink them. There is a couple of worried glances from some of them but arrogance jumps in when one stocky man says that no woman would out drink him. You smile and laugh to yourself, you know that if these men drank with some of the mining girls they would have a big shock. Just the wine sipping exec girls they hang out with, don’t give the big picture. Privileged idiots you think to yourself. As the first wave of shots arrive you tell the waitress to come back with a different beverage, you are definitely going to mix the drinks up.\n\nYou glance over at the hooker, who has backed out of the drinking competition saying she can’t handle it. While this encourages the men to goad you, you find it amusing to gauge the hookers face. You know what she is thinking, will it be a gangbang of 6-8 drunken men, or will most of them be really incapacitated by the alcohol. The rich boys that they are, means the embarrassment of publicly not getting it up, is far worse that missing an opportunity to fuck a high-class whore.  Being a professional she keeps up her flirtatious charade but takes an opportunity to tell you it’s more for group sex.\n \n&lt;&lt;if $M4outfit is 1&gt;&gt; [[The Seduction|MV4.2s]]\n&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;[[The Seduction|MV4.2]]&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n</div><div tiddler="MV4.2" tags="" created="201704161029" modifier="twee" twine-position="2390,4910">During the time with Paul you been subtly playing with Paul, despite seeing the videos of you at Shebo, Paul has been enjoying sidelong glances at your clothed figure.

This gives the few remaining men encouragement, that they won’t be defeated in the drinking competition.\n\nYou glance over at your hooker, sandwiched on the sofa by two drunken men, hands roaming all over her body. Still dressed though, probably as these men have wives and girlfriends close by, it would not pay to be found having a blowjob.

You ask why the Evictors would attend when mechs could be used at a later date, mainly as they could seal the creatures into a zone. This is where the ruthlessness comes in, big time.  The ‘dogs’ are going to be released on the //others//, scientists that believe in the Xena dream, the Evictors will be ordered to try and save as many as possible as those staff have high value to the wider Xena organisation. \n\nOnce everything is planned out you tell the two scientists that 5 minutes after the alarm goes off, they are to make their escape alone.  They looked concerned at this but tell them that you want to get into the computer core area, and work out what it is for.  Once you have done that, you will head back and catch up with them. Knowing they have a large climb ahead of them, you know you will catch up.\n\nYou tell them that it is risky, you doubt that the Evictors will send anyone from down here after them, but they will know two people have escaped, and will know where the ventilation shaft leads. So the easiest option would be to send ground based troops to the mine entrance, and maybe send some in.

Just for added fun you decide to pull down the front of her dress exposing her tits, as the shocked Sarah moves to cover them with her hands you then reach down and pull up the sides of her mid thigh dress until the bunched fabric reaches her belly button. By the roar of the audience the tattoo is still there and Sarah pushes down with her arms to get you to release the bottom of the dress.\n\nThis succeeds and the dress goes down, but her tits are exposed again and she then turns around pulls the dress front up and runs off towards the toilets. You find yourself in a room of shocked execs who are afraid of their boss enough not to cheer, but clearly enjoyed the spectacle. You make your way out of the party and take a few numbers, you may need to call in a simple bribe if things go wrong with Sarah.\n\nAn hour later you are invited to Helen’s party by a third party, some of the IT execs posted a few images of the Shebo girl and an embarrassed Sarah Thornton. \n\n[[Return to Apartment|Apartment]]\n&lt;&lt;set $Mis4 to &quot;True&quot;&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Int8 to &quot;Complete&quot;&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="SC87" tags="" created="201704302226" modifier="twee" twine-position="7990,2530">//While some of Celeste's thought process was nobile in intent and she was asked to do it, Celeste took great delight in taking the dominant role of Mistress to Lina//\n\nYour ''Training'' has increased by 1%.

So while Lina is stood there in her sheer gown you strip off your jumpsuit and sit back down on the sofa legs spread.\n\n&quot;Well Lina if you want to be punished then you had better start licking, on your knees girl and loose the gown&quot; you command.\n\nLina looks at you intently and removes the gown in a seductive manner, not that it really made much difference. Lina then steps in front of you and kneels down and starts to nuzzle and delicately lick your lips and clit. You lean back in the sofa enjoying your reward. You have been aroused in the match, after the match and all the time walking back to this apartment so this is a time you totally relax and reach a blissful state soon afterwards.\n\nAs Lina's attentions start to really fire up your juices you reach forwards and grab her head with your hands and jam it into your crotch. Lina’s licking gets more frantic as you start to buck and gyrate your hips, when you orgasm starts to get closer you remove your hands and lean back on the sofa, lost in a series of moans and groan. As the impending orgasm starts to hit you wrap your legs around Lina and roughly squeeze her into your pussy until you climax and gyrate your juices all over her face. When you calm down you release Lina who looks at you really pleased. Lina goes to carry on but you shoo her off, too sensitive for any more.\n\nAs you come around, Lina offers to let her massage you which you readily agree to. You find yourself lying down on a fur rug with Lina sat astride you, her public hair brushing on your back. Lina then proceeds to give you a great back massage. As you are being massaged Lina hits you with a barrage of questions about where you trained and how long you have been practicing.  You hint that maybe you need some more action after all of that, maybe a good finger massage but Lina tells you that she will treat you if you come to her father’s house; quite simply she will make you cum, if you come. Well you found the pun amusing. It is time to go. You get dressed and give Lina a quick kiss before you go.\n\n[[Head back to your apartment|Apartment][$Days = $Days + 0.5]] &lt;&lt;set $Int17 to &quot;True&quot;&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;set $Dojo to 3&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Dojo2C2" tags="" created="201512202152" modifier="twee" twine-position="1970,1410">In the next round you delight in slashing her outfit to bits which exposes her breasts and nipples through the shredded fabric. Lina’s hakama is made to resemble a mini skirt as she rips off a trailing piece of fabric to prevent herself from falling again. You admire her lithe body, covered in sweat and minor lacerations from your sword strikes. Lina is not giving in without a fight and knows that by playing with her you have also given her a good chance to win the match.\n\nWhen Lina presses you hard you are forced to choose between between a quick death blow against her or risking your own defeat. You quickly cut her down and end the match causing the area to refresh. This time. Lina has slipped into a new ‘outfit’. You are taken aback as Lina has gotten rid of the computer generated hakama and kimono and is now entirely naked. You admire her form for a few long seconds until Lina speak up.\n\n&quot;Seeing how much you enjoyed exposing my body, I thought I would save you the trouble. See anything you like, Celeste?&quot; she states flatly, a sly smile on her face.\n\n&quot;Oh, I see a lot I like. It’s a shame I can’t enjoy unwrapping my present one last time,&quot; you reply.\n\n&quot;It is not over yet. I may have severely underestiamted you but let's change up the stakes: The forfeit all rides on this last match only. If you win, you’ll get to unwrap this present later. Too bad I’m not going to allow you to do that&quot; states Lina while readying herself. \n\nYou notice that she has taken a very aggressive stance with her legs spread out in a squatting position, sword raised high. Her raised arms puff out her chest making her pointed nipples pronounced and looking down between her legs you can see her lower lips are slightly parted.\n\nLina attacks in a big sweeping motion and you are forced on the defensive. You end up pressed against her, body to body, as you start to grapple. This is the major downside of fighting in these matches: No matter how realistic everything looks, the armour means that you can’t actually tease a naked Lina. All that really registers is the impact of a metal pole (your sword). \n\nYou and Lina grapple back and forth before you finally manage to toss her over your shoulder and take her to the ground. You lock Lina’s arm in a bar and grab your nearby katana which you place against her neck.\n\n&quot;You’ve lost, Lina. It’s time to give up,&quot; you say triumphantly.\n\nLina submits and you let her get back to her feet. You both bow and head to leave the court and get changed and out of the armour. You had agreed to meet Lina in the café when you are both ready and find her sat at a table waiting for you.\n\nYou hold down a normal conversation but you can see the beginnings of reverence in Lina’s eyes and the conversation culminates in an invitation to her father’s house to meet him. You are not sure about this but out of politeness agree. The conversation then moves onto the bet and Lina tells you that she has a small apartment in the Space Quarter she uses as a base of operations; there you will have some privacy. You agree to follow her and her apartment is only a ten-minute walk from Red’s.\n\nWhen you arrive at Lina’s apartment she asks you to wait in the lounge while she slips into something more comfortable. You admire a number of katana and other martial arts equipment on the walls. You are distracted from your admiration once Lina returns in a sheer, see-through dressing gown; another worthy sight for your admiration. You can easily see her nipples and dark triangular bush that is trimmed through the gown. \n\n&quot;Feel free to take a look at the blades. Some are real antiques,&quot; Lina informs you while leaning on a sofa. Her posture results in the dressing gown riding in tantalizing places. Curiosity gets the better of you and you pull a few of the blades down to look at. Lina stands back, watching your eyes, fascinated as you carry out a few swings to get the balance of the blades.\n\n&quot;Lina,&quot; you say still swinging the blades, &quot;have you had any genetic enhancements?&quot; This question has been bugging you since earlier during your match.\n\n&quot;My answer will likely be the exact same as yours, my sword mistress&quot; replies Lina. That answers one question but did Lina just address you as mistress? Before you can think on it further, Lina continues. &quot;Mistress should punish me for not being gifted with the blade&quot; she states in a sincere tone.\n\nYou struggle to keep a surprised look from your face.\n\n[[Test how far she will go with this|Dojo2C3]]\n[[Just have her to lick you out|Dojo2C4]]</div><div tiddler="Dojo2C3" tags="Stat_23" created="201512202152" modifier="twee" twine-position="2250,1410">You look at Lina and decide to test the waters, &quot;Mistress' says you need to fuck yourself with this sword hilt&quot; you say expecting to be told to fuck off.\n\n&quot;That is a fitting punishment for a slut like myself Mistress&quot; Lina says while reaching out for the katana in your hand. You hand it over thinking she must be having you on, but at the same time Lina releases the drawstring of the gown and lets it fall open. Lina holds your gaze while she spreads her legs and guides the sword hilt to her pussy lips and starts teasing herself while holding the sword blade just under the guard with finger and thumb.\n\nYou stand back amazed as she rubs herself with the sword hilt and then starts to insert it in herself then back out, back to rubbing back in, a little more. This cycle goes on several times as the sword hilt goes deeper and deeper, eventually the tip of the blade is placed on the floor and Lina squats down on it literally taking it to the hilt. With this she lets out a guttural moan and flings her head back holding the position for around 20 seconds. As Lina regains her composure she again holds your gaze and starts squatting up and down on the hilt.\n\n&quot;Go on fuck yourself you little slut&quot; you say\n\nLina responds by going faster and faster making her tits bounce to the rhythm and the fabric of the gown to bounce around. Eventually she cums with a long moan. Not finished with her yet you tell her to spread her legs wider, hold her arms out by her side and maintain the star shape with the sword hilt still buried in her pussy with the tip touching the floor. You watch her hold that position while you sit on the sofa watching her intently, admiring how her chest rises and falls and the sword hilt glistens with her juices. \n\nEventually you can’t resist anymore and walk behind her and reach out under her arms and start to play with her nipples, tweaking the roughly. You then reach down to the sword guard and push the blade deeper into her pussy as you lift the tip of the floor. When this gets little reaction you twist the sword slightly and get a slight groan. Bored of your sport you let the blade drop down to the floor and step away and smack her ass, getting more of a reaction to the hilt inserted inside of her.\n\n&quot;It is over&quot; you command and watch as Lina stands up taller and plucks the katana from her pussy. While holding the blade carefully Lina goes off into the kitchen and returns several seconds later with a cloth to clean her juices off the hilt. Lina smiles and joins you on the sofa and you are hit with a barrage of questions about where you trained and how long you have been practicing.  You hint that maybe you need some action after all of that but Lina tells you that she will treat you if you come to her father’s house, quite simply she will make you cum, if you come.

You half-heartedly sidestep away in an attempt to give none of your skill away. After a few more strikes from Lina, you start to get a feel for her. She is quick, though currently you think she is still holding back. Skill wise you think she has got a long way to go though this is likely due to the quality of teachers available and not her natural talent.\n\nIt is time to go on the offensive and you launch a series of strikes at Lina. You swat her backside with the flat of your blade causing her to stumble. It is a pity that the armour takes away most of the impact but you’re sure it still felt like a solid hand thwack against her bum.\n\nAs Lina turns to face you, her face is a mixture of rage, shock, and... lust? It is hard to tell, as she returns her face to rest.\n\n&quot;Well, it is clear you're a lot tougher than I thought. I won't make the mistake of going easy on you any longer. Best of three?&quot; says Lina.\n\n&quot;Best of three //and// the loser takes a punishment&quot; you put forward as a counter offer. It helps to have motivation to fight seriously.\n\nLina arches an eyebrow &quot;What kind of punishment do you have in mind?&quot;\n\n&quot;One which involves very little clothing, most likely&quot; you suggestively offer.\n\nLina's eyes widen and she smiles, then suggestively pokes and wriggles her tongue at you sending a heat to your loins and a smile to your face.  &quot;Slut&quot; she chides at you.&lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Lounge1F&quot;)&gt;&gt; You almost lost focus on the match as you remember cumming all over her face previously. You’ll have to do that again... once you win!&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; With gestures and a comment like that there is no way you can let her win. You give her a lesson in swordsmanship, making her do all of the moving as you dominate the ring. \n\nTo give Lina her dues, she has excellent reflexes which you suspect may be modified. Knowing how important her father may be, likely modifications of the expensive sort, too. What lets her down is her footwork and overall strategy. With the right training she could give you a hard time, and with proper experience, maybe actually beat you. But not today.\n\nWhen you notice Lina starts to get tired you slash down on her hakama with the tip of your blade. This causes the big skirt to fall down and get tangled around her ankles. Since the armour properly reacts to all in game changes and stimuli on the realistic setting, Lina is set off-balance by the skirt and you swing the sword down to her neck. You stop short and leave a simulated shallow cut to her neck instead of simply decapitating her.\n\n&quot;Yield,&quot; you simply state. Lina stands still with a line of blood dripping down her neck, hakama down by her ankles, and you can see her panties underneath her kimono.  You reach out with the tip of your katana until the back of the blade is resting by her pussy lips. With the non-cutting edge of the blade you rub slightly and Lina grins. \n\n&quot;That would probably feel great if this didn’t dull the sensations,&quot; she tells you.\n\n&quot;I’m just imagining how this day is going to end. Are you getting wet while you anticipate your defeat, Lina?&quot; you say seductively.\n\n&quot;It is not over yet,&quot; Lina tells you, though you suspect she knows it is. Maybe she is getting off on this. You know that according to a shiver you just felt you certainly are. \n\n[[This should be easy|either(&quot;Dojo2C2&quot;,&quot;Dojo2C2&quot;,&quot;Dojo2C2A&quot;,&quot;Dojo2C2&quot;)]]</div><div tiddler="Mission 8 Start" tags="" created="201505101307" modifier="twee" twine-position="10,6450">You are not quite sure why you decided to take this mission, there are a number of reasons you can think of. Some follow from the same logic that you joined the military, to do good, some for a sense of finality to this whole affair.  Overall though you think your biggest motivator is purely curiosity, curiosity of what is down there, what Xena have been hiding in this cess pit of a planet.\n\nMaddock has basic facility schematics of the place and indicates that there are three core areas; a lab, lots of warehouses and a command area with a medium power computer system. The command system is connected to an above ground facility, mainly used for communications. The lab is not overly large and Maddock just assumes this was for research that had to be hidden away and possibly dangerous, due to it being separated from the rest of the facility.  The warehouses are big, enough to store a small armies equipment, these came from the Lantis mining efforts. \n\nThe infiltration route leads into from disused mines into a ventilation shaft, it was decided that trying to get into the above ground facility was just too dangerous.  Maddock is supplying a small strike team to provide back up from the mine, they won’t come in with you, but will wait at the top of the ventilation shaft. You doubt they will be of much help, unless you are chased out of the facility, but if that happens escaping the mine could be the biggest problem.  Maddock has thought of that and the backup plan is to hide out in the mine, where supplies will be kept.  It might work, but they will have to catch you first!\n\nThe factor you can’t rely on is whether anyone will join in, now Maddock has analysed the data core and found this place. Will Sid do the same, will Sid be as quick as Maddock, or was Maddock slow?  If Sid has sent a team, then whatever is down there may be gone or destroyed.  The worst-case scenario is that Sid’s team stirs up the hornets nest, leaving you in a bit of a situation.  Time will tell you think to yourself.  What cheers you up is complimenting Maddock’s strike force is Jane, the irony is what amuses you, this could be the death of both of you. \n\nAs you are travelling to the location you find yourself listening to the news with rapt attention. There is a big discussion over the bringing forward of the decommissioning of the Hyperion and Odyssey.  You served on the Odyssey, the flagship of the Commonwealth fleet, a ship capable of transporting a brigade of marines and all their equipment to a star system.  The key thing with both the ships is that they are jump capable, meaning they are not reliant on jumpgates.  The downside is that jump drives are extremely expensive and not needed for anything but exploration vessels. The argument is the same, what happens if a rebel planet destroys the jump-gates in its system. But jump-gates are quite well guarded, and reinforcements close by, which has meant both ships are heading for mothballing and parts stripping. \n\n&lt;&lt;if $XenaKey is 1&gt;&gt;[[There is one thing troubling you|FM1A]]\n&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;[[Get ready for the infiltration|FM1]] &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\n\n</div><div tiddler="GregMail2" tags="" created="201607081803" modifier="twee" twine-position="2390,10">&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;1.5&quot;&gt;Subject: Hey, Honey ;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;From: My Love [d.bonalski@freemail.sef]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Received one minute ago.

No hard feelings though, mate.\n\nAnyways, I happen to be on vacation and wouldn't you know it, I happen to be staying at the same resort as your wife. I ran into her down at the bar with a few of her friends the other day. I don't believe she recognized me but I introduced her after I noticed another guy hitting on her after she'd had a few drinks and her friends had left her alone. Don't worry, man. I managed to get her back to her hotel room and made sure she was comfortable before leaving her alone for the evening. Just wanted to let you know as soon as I got back to my room so that you could check in on her if you need to.\n\nCrazy how small the universe is.\n\n\n-Greg, Accounting X.C.\n&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</div><div tiddler="Combat Droids" tags="" created="201612301706" modifier="twee" twine-position="8130,10">Combat Droids are the next advancement of mech security bots, the key difference is versatility and significantly more advanced combat and friend/foe analysis.\n\nEssentially a military development programme called for humans to lead squads of bipedal combat mechs, mechs that had the ability to follow instructions, understand military tactics and carry out a number of tasks without human instruction. The difference being that current mechs are programmed to carry out a limited function, e.g. patrol XYZ location, neutralise intruders via friend/foe recognition. While some friend/foe recognition was fairly advanced, it was simply the mech waiting for human assistance or other inputs to come out (such as under fire, or the intruder running away).\n\nWhat this meant was that mechs were useful for security duties and warfare such as hunter-killer and air defence. Where mechs failed were in operations where friend/foe recognition was difficult such as in counter insurgency. This started off the combat droid programme due to distrust and the cost of manufacturing genetically engineered soldiers. It was known that training human soldiers to a high level, and then embedding implants was very expensive. More so than technologies such as vat grown soldiers. \n\nThe military programme used the name ‘Droids’ to distinguish from the term ‘Mechs’ to highlight the higher artificial intelligence.  The programme was controversial and while development is ongoing a number of organisations are scared of security forces being comprised of mechs, ‘clone’ troopers and now ‘droids’.\n\nYou carried out an infiltration mission on a leading developer of combat droids.

As soon as he realizes you're ready to go, you hear his pants drop to the ground and feel him penetrate your submitting body with ease.\n\nHe fucks you hard against the dresser and gives no care to your physical safety or enjoyment. You get the feeling your ribs will be bruised along with your legs because of his brutish technique yet your pussy only seems to get wetter. It takes all of your might to fight back cries of agony and pleasure but you hold out hope he'll finish before Carla returns and sees you both. Perhaps somehow responding to your desperation, or instead to your needy little pussy that was milking it for all it was worth, Jake finally grunts and empties his pent up frustration deep inside your hole.\n\n&quot;Fuuuuuck, babe. You've got a sweet cunt,&quot; he says pulling out as his cum drips from you. &quot;Thanks for a good fuck.&quot;\n\nInstead of offering you the key though, Jake instead starts to dress and leaves you slumped over the dresser. You quickly come to terms with the fact you've been played and resign yourself to your fate. A few minutes after he leaves, a very disappointed Carla comes in and frees you and looks over your would be uniform in its now tattered state.\n\n&quot;I guess it's fitting, since you failed. I can't make an exception after you violated the no penetrations rule, even if it was forced. I guess you're just meant to be a sub and nothing more, Celeste,&quot; she laments.\n\n[[Finish getting cleaned up and leave|Apartment][$Days = $Days + 0.5]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC99&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $Mental += 4&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $DommeTrg to 4&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="RTG2.2" tags="" created="201608161153" modifier="twee" twine-position="1690,5330">A series of gunshots wake you from your reverie but the echo of the tunnels makes it difficult to pinpoint how close they were. You soon hear footsteps and wonder whether this will turn out to be a contestant or Shadow Viper herself. You get yourself ready to strike but it turns out to be another contestant and you let yourself relax again for a brief moment until you hear another set of footsteps, someone creeping, in the background.\n\nThe noise disappears and your implants kick in, filtering out your heart beat and other ambient sounds from your hearing. It is faint and intermittent but you’re certain that the contestant is being stalked. The roar of a pistol being fired followed by a scream and then a limping run indicate the contestant has been hit in the leg.\n\nShadow Viper walks past, ass swaying and in no rush as she follows her target. Shadow Viper has holstered her pistols, conveying an arrogance to the delight of the cameras. With a motion sensor and blood trail, the contestant would normally be doomed, but they’ll have a bit more time in this world due to your imminent ambush.\n\nYou pounce from your hiding spot and are quickly amused by the motion sensor going off and how startled Shadow Viper is by its sudden blaring alarm. Her focus is in the direction of the shot contestant and although her reactions are fast, they are not fast enough for the brick that strikes her temple or your body slamming into hers, sending her crashing to the floor and you rolling away. You rise to your feet from the roll and you know you have succeeded; Shadow Viper is out for the count and any worry that she was physically enhanced ebbs away. \n\nTaking no chances, you jump on top of her intending to knock the wind out of her if she is conscious and it jolts her back away. You grapple with the dazed woman, flinging her pistols to the sides of the chamber and then choking her out. You bind her arms, collect the pistols, and think about what to do next.\n&lt;&lt;set $Contestants -= 2&gt;&gt;\n[[Leave Shadow Viper to her fate|RTG2.3]]\n[[Wake her up and take her with you|RTG2.4]]</div><div tiddler="RTG2.3A" tags="Stat_76" created="201608161154" modifier="twee" twine-position="1970,5330">You are quite aware that other contestants could be bribed by Charles to end you if he’s found out you are participating. It doesn’t hurt that the barbarity loving fans will love you more if you do something shocking like this. You feel a ping of guilt as the contestant sees you, panics, recovers when you are recognised, then looks horrified once he realises that you’re raising a gun at him. Your shot is clean and between his eyes, killing him instantly. As you step over the body, you become aware that the camera drone that was recording Shadow Viper is now following you.\n\nThe rest of your trek through the tunnels is uneventful. At one point, you come spot another contestant in the distance, let off a few rounds, but ultimately because they reacted quickly. You wonder how the show’s management will try to get the guns off of you. When you reach the exit for the tunnels, a contestant visibly flinches when she sees the gun. You’re both not allowed to speak but it is clear she wants to know if you killed Shadow Viper. No-one from the show’s management comes out to retrieve the weapon and you both take a seat in a booth to watching the video feeds of the tunnels.\n\nOne feed shows Shadow Viper, now awake and using some sense, has pushed herself head first into the spot where you hid to ambush her. You wonder how she feels with her arms bound behind her back, having had to wriggle like a worm into a hole. If anyone found her like this, she would be in a very compromising position. You can imagine the game show hosts upping the suspense by showing nearby contestants to the audience and perhaps even giving the contestants hints and tips to encourage a different hunt.\n\nShadow Viper survives and all of the remaining contestants make it in. They all take in the pistols next to you and work out what has happened. When you are all called in for the next round a couple of armed show security staff take the weapons off you, saying nothing else. The $Contestants remaining contestants are split up and individually taken by vehicle to the starting points of the next challenge; the sniper alley. You hope she isn’t feeling too arrogant because you have a little surprise coming her way.\n\n[[Competition thins as the games continue|RTG3][$Contestants -= 1]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC76&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;&lt;set $Training += 1&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;set $Viper to 1&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="GalCel4" tags="" created="201711181609" modifier="twee" twine-position="8130,150">&lt;div class=&quot;polaroid&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=data/in13.png&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celeste Shebo&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/td&gt;</div><div tiddler="GalCel3" tags="" created="201711181609" modifier="twee" twine-position="7990,150">&lt;div class=&quot;polaroid&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=data/in12.png&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celeste Gym&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/td&gt;</div><div tiddler="GalCel2" tags="" created="201710151400" modifier="twee" twine-position="7850,150">&lt;div class=&quot;polaroid&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=data/in11.png&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celeste&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/td&gt;</div><div tiddler="GalCel1" tags="" created="201710151357" modifier="twee" twine-position="7710,150">&lt;div class=&quot;polaroid&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=data/in1.png&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celeste&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </div><div tiddler="RTGB" tags="" created="201608262122" modifier="twee" twine-position="3510,5470">&lt;img src=data/rtg5.png&gt;\n\n&lt;img src=data/rtg6.png&gt;</div><div tiddler="RTG2.1" tags="" created="201608161150" modifier="twee" twine-position="1550,5330">When all the contestants are accounted for, either having arrived or died, you are taken by transport to the next round. This stage is all underground and some of it was likely built just for the show. The bulk consists of old mining tunnels, industrial ducts, and utility access lanes. Water is too scare here for any of it to be used for sewers, so at least there will be no wading through waste deep water and waste.\n\nYou wonder idly if Charles is worried yet or has even paid any direct attention to the contestants; to him the contestants are just cattle. In this round all $Contestants of the remaining contestants are dropped off in one place at the start of the tunnels. There are four paths to choose from and you know from examining the maps that these branch off into other directions and connect at certain junctures. This tunnel complex is a proper maze and while most of it is lit, there are a few sections where the lighting is much less frequent.\n\nYou have a serious advantage in this round since you know the area at least as well as the hunter, or Shadow Viper, in this case. You’re aware of her starting point and have looked at her old video footage to decided on an ambush point. You wait for the other contestants to make their move and the group quickly splits up on the basis the more scattered everyone is, the better the odds that even more people will get through since Shadow Viper is also on foot.\n\nYou are aware that Shadow Viper has a motion sensor as part of her equipment but with your experience as an infiltrator you have found a hiding spot wedged in between some thick, steel pipes. This will throw the motion sensor off, ensure that you can’t be seen easily, and give you a great ambush point. This area is on Shadow Viper’s suggested route from the producers to help maximize casualties. You assume she will head down here several times over the course of this round. Now it is just a waiting game and you allow yourself relax; this is all so reminiscent of your specialty.\n\n[[Relax as you wait for Shadow Viper to appear|RTG2.2]]</div><div tiddler="Carla3" tags="" created="201801011903" modifier="twee" twine-position="1830,570">As you walk up to the receptionist at the desk, she looks up and leers at you.\n\n&quot;Here for another session with Carla, I presume?&quot; she asks in a bored, monotone voice.

Within a few minutes, she returns with Carla at her side. \n\nCarla greets you then asks you to follow her to her office.\n\nYou somehow aren't that surprised you've been drawn back to Carla like a moth to a flame.

As you quickly approach the goal, you hear some shuffling from around a nearby corner as another contestant cautiously walks out in front of you.\n\nThey still haven’t noticed you yet but likely will any second if you don’t do anything. You could let them know what just happened so they can avoid Shadow Viper and head for the goal but it may be better to avoid the extra suspicion; it might even be safer just to take them out.\n\n[[Shoot them|RTG2.3A]]\n[[Don't tell them about Shadow Viper|RTG2.3B]]\n[[Tell them about Shadow Viper|RTG2.3C]]</div><div tiddler="Evindium" tags="" created="201409231246" modifier="twee" twine-position="4490,10">&lt;h3&gt;Evindium&lt;/h3&gt;\nEvindium Prime is a [[colony world]] under the strict control of a consortium of large corporations, including the Xena Corporation. The planet is roughly Earth sized and is mostly an arid, desert like planet undergoing its fiftieth year of terraforming. \n\nThrough the terraforming efforts it has a developed a thin but breathable atmosphere. The planet is largely uninhabited and colonists were prohibited to settle outside the Evindium City by the corporations. This was to make sure that the corporations could survey the planet for natural resources without having to worry about people setting up homes on top of such natural riches.\n\nEvindium City is a large sprawling city with around twelve million inhabitants divided into various hubs; Space Quarter, Downtown, Corporate district, and industrial areas.\n\nThe Space Quarter is centered on a space elevator linking the city to the orbiting space station. It is connected to the various landing platforms, hangars, and related facilities like warehouses and hotels, by a metro system. The Space Quarter is separated from the rest of the city by security checkpoints and all of the Evindium’s off world freight and business transactions are carried out there. The area is very high tech and contained fully indoors.\n\nCorporate areas are heavily guarded compounds containing staff’s living quarters and corporate offices and facilities. Access to the areas is restricted and monitored. Complexes inside vary from science and technology research facilities to business headquarters and planetary administration buildings. The higher level corporate workers live on site while the industrial and general office workforce make the daily commute from Downtown.\n\nDowntown is a largely unpoliced area where the quality of life can vary from the safe, gated community of high-rise buildings and shopping malls protected by private security firms all the way down to the high crime rate red lights district and slums where taking a stroll down the dark alleyways looking like a corporate person with no security will get you mugged or worse. Using the Metro is generally deemed safest due to their private security force. \n\nThe industrial areas are scattered outside the city and provide the core infrastructure of power, water, sewage treatment, building materials, and ore processing for off world commerce. Industrial areas also hold the atmospheric and water processing plants which slowly terraform Evindium.\n\nCorporations maintained control over the general populace through military power and high security border control, stopping most of the high tech weapons coming into the system. Their technological superiority allows them to operate with a smaller security force.\n\n&lt;&lt;back&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="RTG2.5" tags="" created="201608181313" modifier="twee" twine-position="2670,5330">When you reach the end, only one other contestant has made it. While contestants who have finished are supposed to stay in their finish booths, this contestant has been allowed out. You’re sure the show’s producers are likely hoping for some more drama for the cameras since you brought this huntress with you.\n\nThe contestant, a man, speaks up, &quot;I saw what happened on the feed but I couldn’t believe it was really happening. You actually cut a hole to show her pussy?!&quot;\n\nHis eyes immediately dart down between her thighs and went wide as he realizes it all really had taken place. Clearly excited, you come up with an idea that will shock him even more.\n\n&quot;Do you want to fuck her? You could be the first contestant to fuck a hunter, live on the show,&quot; you suggest.\n\n&quot;R-Really?! Hell yes!&quot; the man screams and makes his way towards you both.\n\n&quot;Fuck this!&quot; Shadow Viper screams. &quot;There is no way in hell the show’s going to allow this. Try anything and security will be in here in a flash. Just you watch.&quot;\n\nThe man hesitates even after you bend her bound body over a concrete block, but she gasps in surprise when instead of security, three more camera drones fly in and position themselves around her and the room. The contestant takes this as their seal of approval and you smile as he forces her legs apart and inserts his cock in her.  You step back and watch as he roughly fucks her into the block, punishing the sadistic killer for the entertainment of the masses and his own pleasure.\n\nYou contemplate in a moment of self-reflection just how you’d handle being taken like this If the positions were reversed. Would you be enjoying it? You can’t tell if Shadow Viper is since she’s made little noise, accepting the fate dealt to her now that she knows the show won’t help her out. You wonder how she will react when she realized you intend to leave her there to service all the contestants as they arrive; not very pleased, you’d imagine.\n\n[[Let her just desserts continue|RTG2.6]]</div><div tiddler="RTG2.4" tags="" created="201608161153" modifier="twee" twine-position="2390,5330">With Shadow Viper bound and unconscious, you search her for ammunition and weapons. You find a concealed blade in the sole of her boot and modify it so you can attach it to your own without risk of injury. You then decide to throw one pistol away so you have a hand free to control her with. You check the bindings on her wrists and then give her a good slap across the face.\n\n''*SMACK*''\n\nWith a gasp, she comes around. Now on all fours, her hands restrained behind her, you stand astride her she can’t get up and try anything stupid.\n\n&quot;You bitch,&quot; she grumbles, still looking at the ground before turning to you. &quot;What the fuck is wrong with you?&quot;\n\nYou smile back and say nothing. The pistol pointing at her head explains the situation well enough, you’re sure. You give her a few seconds and note her shoulder muscles flexing to test the bonds. Once she settles down and gains a more resigned expression, you decide it’s time to explain your game.\n\n&quot;You are going to be my trophy and are going to be walking back, a walk of shame and total defeat. Play by my rules and you will live. Don’t and you won’t. Do you understand me?&quot; you ask, a small smile appearing on your lips.\n\nShadow Viper takes in the comment and nods.\n\n&quot;I don’t believe you but dying right now isn’t in the cards for me, so let’s go already,&quot; she responds.\n\nYou pick up on a bit of sincere confidence on her part; perhaps she hopes to soon escape with the concealed blade you took from her. You decide you’ll let her keep her false hopes for when, not if, she decides to try and make a move on you and escape. When she inevitably does, her despair should be entertaining for the camera. You move from above her and let her get up, using your left arm to guide her by her wrists.\n\nA hard slap on her ass helps her on her way and garners a grunt in response. Your walk through the tunnels is peaceful and when other contestants spot her they don’t hang around long enough to check out the situation. You’re sure some run off with a load of doubt in their mind about what they just saw but none are stupid or brave enough to have a second look.\n\n[[Keep heading towards your goal|RTG2.4A]]</div><div tiddler="Carla2" tags="" created="201508220856" modifier="twee" twine-position="1130,570">&lt;&lt;if $CarlaTrg &gt;= 1&gt;&gt;As you walk up to the receptionist at the desk, she looks up and leers at you.\n\n&quot;Here for another session with Carla, I presume?&quot; she asks in a bored, monotone voice.

One is a hard looking female receptionist in a corset, black, latex leggings, and thigh-high laced boots. The other is a muscular male, dressed in a leather waistcoat and leather trousers. It is clear to you that the receptionist is Carla’s assistant; her eyes follow you like a hawk stalking its prey. The male however looks like he’s just there as security and possibly a helper.\n\nAs you approach the counter the receptionist speaks up, &quot;Hello, do you have an appointment?&quot; Her tone implies she is already well aware of your answer.\n\n&quot;No&quot;, you reply, &quot;I'm just here at Carla's invitation. The name is Celeste, please pass it to her.&quot;\n\nThe Receptionist looks at you while attempting to deduce if you are a customer, friend of Carla’s, a business associate, or something else entirely. It is clear she cannot make up her mind so asks the security person to go and speak to Carla. \n\n&quot;Carla is with a customer at the moment, so Jim here will tell her you are here.

Five minutes comes and goes, yet you still find yourself standing, waiting for Carla to come. A few minutes later, Carla comes in wearing a leather fetish outfit that makes you look her over twice.

Directly opposite you is an occupied cell and you see a naked girl sat in the corner with a collar. You watch her for a bit and try your luck in getting her attention by rattling the bars. The girl looks at you, stands up, and comes to the cage bars.\n\n&quot;You new girl. You not yet a good slave, so you act silly. You sit down in the cell and wait for your new master. Master will give you big happiness,&quot; comes a monotone voice. The girl then turns around and sits back down in the cell. You are stunned that the girl has been brainwashed and you wonder if it is too late for Sarah Tranter. \n\nWith a sinking feeling you sit back on your mattress and try to get some rest. You’ve reached the point of giving up to talking to anyone you hear a shout. \n\n&quot;Hey, new girl. Number 33 is a broken slut but not all of us are.

Jane has identified a number of places that she thinks will be beneficial for you to visit, after a few hours discussing the pros and cons you both agree on the following places;\n\n__Downtown__\n''Miners Arms'' – The Magnum needs a repair and only the small independent outfits may chance a black-market deal. Come on, most will recognise damage from gun fire, so you are going to want to find an outfit that will take a risk, and take the money.  This is where the Miners Arms comes into it, the place is a firm favourite with the independent mining organisations, Evindium has a lot of very rare minerals and spacecraft the size of yours are fairly common for high value loads.  So, there are going to be people who can fix the ship up, you just need to find someone willing to do it, and get the money in place.\n\n''Hypermarket'' – Away from the Magnum, busy….. You are going to need to stock up your apartment with foodstuffs.  Simple but boring really.  Place might have some other useful gear, so worth checking out.\n\n''HBBO Bank'' – Jane has located a smaller branch of the intergalactic bank, outside of the Space Quarter.  You both expect large sums of money transferred on planet to be scrutinised, but risks are often worth taking. Maybe.\n\n__Space Quarter__\n''Reds Space Bar'' – This is a place where you can keep a view on what is going on planet wide, a place geared for the space traveller.  Maybe an investor, maybe a corporate exec or maybe a mercenary trading on corporate misadventure. The place is a haunt of a number of intelligence brokers, all making a trade.\n\n''The Lounge'' – A VIP location where all the best parties are arranged, it mainly serves as a meeting place for the wealthy, part restaurant and part bar.  While at first you will not be able to get in, you are sure you can find a way in.  Do a few favours for the wealthy, is going to bring some opportunity.\n\n''Evindium's Weapons Emporium'' – The premiere weapons establishment, now while you have a couple of assault rifles and combat armour on the Magnum, you need something a little more subtle, and a few bits of kit geared up for dealing with the unarmoured rabble you are going to find on planet.\n\n//Which ones to try first?//  \n\n[[Return to Apartment|Apartment]]\n&lt;&lt;set $Unlock1 to 1&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Int26 to &quot;Complete&quot;&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Days to $Days +0.5&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="MadH3.5" tags="Objective" created="201704262234" modifier="twee" twine-position="2810,2530">Maddock takes you into a side room and gives you a big smile, you know then that this has been a success and Maddock quickly confirms it;\n\n&quot;All records relating to an arrest warrant for Jane have been purged, I have also moved her DNA and retina data to a new profile with a different name&quot;.\n\nYou think on this, Jane will now be able to leave the planet with a new identity, but you have one question;\n\n&quot;How do I explain that I arrived with Jane, now I am leaving with someone else&quot; you ask\n\n&quot;The records have been changed to say that you arrived with Jane's new identity, they will never know. The only issue you have is Xena will have Jane's real data and may work it out&quot; adds Maddock.\n\nYou think it over, Xena and other corporations have a lesser interest in the minions, if they captured you or Jane they would be unlikely to identify Sid. They would also find it hard to capture either of you alive. So, would then continue the search after two months, or check the planetary data core records? Maybe, maybe not. Potentially Jane will have to stay away from planets where Xena have some control.\n\nMaddock seems to read your mind, there is a way to get to the Xena company data core he tells you. You tell Maddock that you will think about it, but first you need to test the system. To get into the Space Quarter there are two check zones, the first on the Metro station before the Space Quarter and then proper checks in the Space Quarter. You tell Maddock that you are going to get Jane, and try and get access, Jane will then change her mind and flee, while you will wait around and see if any security show up.\n\nMaddock looks and you and smiles;\n\n&quot;No security will show up Celeste, I altered the data core personally, but I get you, test it in a safe place as up in space you have almost no escape options&quot;.\n\nWith that you leave and call Jane to give her the good news. Jane then meets you at the meeting place and tries to access the Space Quarter. Jane's visa is approved and then Jane turns round and leaves the Metro. You wait, and wait, expecting security to turn up, or an announcement of a train 'delay'. Nothing...........\n\nIt seems good, and you feel the excitement building in you.

On the pages are a number of designs focused around the pussy and pubic mound areas. Some feature words, designs, or a combination of both.

When you get inside the receptionist smiles, and ushers you to a waiting room chair, to wait for Carla to arrive.\n\nCarla leaves you waiting, clearly your first session as a paying customer doesn't mean much, your mind wanders, is this a test, to see what spirit you have left? To see whether you will get up, complain or even walk out? You seem to come to a decision, you are going to ask the receptionist what is going on.

Your wrists are locked into cuffs that connect at the wrist and connected by a rope to the wall. Your feet are individually cuffed to chains that keep them nearly a meter apart. Secured, Carla gives your restraints a good tug to make sure they hold before allowing herself a smug snicker at your compromised state.\n\n&quot;I wonder how you'd react if I just left you chained up here for a day or two?&quot; she jokingly questions aloud as she presses her chest into your back and moves her hands to your breasts. &quot;I doubt you'd find it that bad if I came back and teased you every hour or two, would it?&quot;\n\n&quot;You wouldn't actually do that, would you?&quot; your voice revealing a mix of fear and elation at the concept.\n\n&quot;Mmmm,&quot; she hums, dropping one hand to your thigh and caressing it. &quot;Only when you beg me to, dear,&quot; she murmurs before nibbling on your ear, her hand grasping your panties before twisting the waistband, &quot;And you //''will''// beg me for things like this,&quot; she says jerking your panties sharply up into your pussy before tearing them away completely.\n\n&quot;Oh my!

Once you are both naked, you get him on his back, straddle him so his erect cock is poking you in the back, and start to apply the cuffs to his arms. When his arms are restrained, you blindfold him and he starts to protest\n\n&quot;Don’t worry. Oral stimulation with your eyes covered is some of the best you'll ever have,&quot; you say as you slide down and take his cock in your mouth. His protest stops and you continue to blow him until he gets off. While he is recovering, you restrain his legs in a spread-eagle position and then gag him and add ear muffs so he can’t hear.\n\nDuring this time, the bug has positioned itself and you get dressed and amuse yourself by running one of your socks up and down his overly sensitive cock. When you’ve had your fun, you leave Chris fully restrained and get up to leave the room.\n\n[[Time to quit|PB5.1]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC52&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;&lt;set $Training = $Training + 0.5&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;elseif $pbs &gt; 5&gt;&gt; Before he heads off to study, you plant the seed in his head that you used to really get off on how livid your parents would be if you fucked someone in their bed.

You feel your body stretch as he attaches your wrists to a spreader bar on your ankles and he pushes you forward into the bed. A bit gag and some reigns are attached to your mouth to complete the outfit.\n\nChris starts off fucking you roughly in this position and quickly cums from all of the excitement. You hope that this is the end but Chris does not release you. You stare to the side and find some comfort in the fact the bug is securely in position as you plead as best you can with the gag into be set free.\n\n&quot;I’m sorry, what's that,&quot; Chris asks with a laugh at your muffled cries. &quot;I can’t understand you. Try and speak clearer.&quot;\n\nChris continues to torment you like this for a few moments before removing your gag and letting you speak. \n\n&quot;Please, Chris, you have to set me free,&quot; you beg with wide eyes.\n\n&quot;I'll think about it. First, you need a spanking though for being such a dirty girl,&quot; he says with a wicked smile. Chris then continually spanks you and you make no noise or reaction. Your silent tactic works and Chris gets bored and releases your arms. He then watches you in amusement as you sit on the bed, legs spread wide, as you remove the spreader bar.\n\n&quot;I hope you know that you are easiest and sluttiest bodyguard I have ever had,&quot; he says with a laugh as he looks you over. &quot;I'd love to have you watch me again, especially on the weekends so you don’t mess up my studies.&quot;\n\nYou say little in reply but are certain your face is red. You wonder if Chris will be in this mansion much longer since the bugs may mean the end of his dad’s business empire. You get dressed, his cum still inside you, and head straight for the Business Manager's office when you exit.\n\n[[Time to get out of here|PB5.2]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC53&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;&lt;set $Mental = $Mental + 2&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;set $Training = $Training + 1&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Before he heads off to study, you plant the seed in his head that you used to really get off on how livid your parents would be if you fucked someone in their bed.

When Chris opens the door to show it off to his friends, you can tell why he'd use this vehicle. it is practically a mobile office, with computer screens, an input terminal, and everything else you might need to work on the go. You know you need to get a bug in Chris's dad's car after seeing all of this\n\nThe bugs are spider-like devices that can move themselves into place and then be triggered remotely. The problem is while moving they are visible, so you need to keep everyone distracted for the length of time it takes for the slow moving bug to get out of your bag, scuttle into position, and then embed itself. \n\nThere are a couple of ways you could approach this: &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;PB2B2&quot;)&gt;&gt;You're sure after letting him in your pants once already, Chris would be eager to fuck you in his dad's car&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You could suggest Chris and you spend some time in the back seat; you know he'd be unable to keep his hands to themselves.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; The other option is to give an almost cliché bikini sponge wash of the car.

The TV screens flicker back on and start displaying the feed of two different camera drones, one of which is following the contestant while the other appears to be randomly floating around the building’s halls. You get the feeling they’ve invested more behind the scenes work into this building than its appearance lets on but it is all in line with the floor plans you had obtained earlier.\n\nThe first contestant chooses a metallic bat and briefly considers taking the elevator in the lobby before taking a left and following the first floor hall to a stairwell. Although poorly lit, he doesn’t encounter and surprises, nor do the feeds suggest anything is wrong until he makes it to the sixth floor. To his horror, he sees a sign that reads ‘''Stairwell A - NO ROOF/MAINTENANCE ACCESS''’ in bright, red letters. He keeps his resolve and bolts through the stairwell door only to literally run into the Masked Mamba himself.\n\nAdrenaline taking over and reorienting himself, the contestant swings his bat at his would-be executor. The Masked Mamba takes a step back, pivots, and uses the man’s momentum to toss him to the ground. The contestant scrambles forwards and to his feet as the hunter just stares him down. The man raises the bat above his head, screams, then rushes at the hunter and brings his bat crashing down towards his skull. The assailant crosses his arms over his head, blocking the bat and actually denting it as the contestant stumbles back in horror and disbelief.\n\n&quot;//Fuck,//&quot; you think to yourself. &quot;//They must have modified the plating in his suit from previous games after how things turned out in the earlier matches.//&quot;\n&lt;&lt;set $Contestants -= 1&gt;&gt;\nRun the Gauntlet’s resident ninja then swiftly snaps the contestants neck and walks away from the cameras and back into the darkness of the poorly lit halls. &lt;&lt;set $Contestants2 to ($Contestants - 1)&gt;&gt;You aren’t surprised when none of the other $Contestants2 contestants don't fare much better, none making it past the fourth floor after the first round.

After sorting out your pay and contract she explains the house rules to you. You are fairly bored by the conversation until she tells you that you are not allowed to have a sexual relationship with the boss’s son. When she emphasizes the point again, you simply remind her that you are a professional.\n\nThe woman sighs and explains that the boy demands female bodyguards and then spends his time trying to get into their panties. The father humors his son and lets him get away with it as long as it does not put the son at risk. The Head of Security has been going through female bodyguards faster than they can find qualified ones. The son either succeeds in his conquest or the woman leaves out of frustration. They hope the son will eventually grow bored and will lose his fascination with seducing the bodyguards and actually let them teach him something. After all, whores can be bought and lots of girls will throw themselves at the rich.\n\nYou can’t help but wonder how they don’t see that by implementing such a rule, it has only made it a further challenge that excites the son. The Business Manager outlines that you are on trial for the next few days and will have an easy assignment. The son, who goes by the name Chris, is staying in the villa. Your first job requirement is to run a self-defence session for Chris, which you anticipate will take up most of the mornings. This leaves you a day and a half to plant the various bugs necessary to get paid. Some rooms such as the Master Bedroom are out of bounds for your access pass, so you will need to get Chris to let you in one way or the other. It is going to be quite hard to avoid Chris getting your panties down while still getting access to everywhere you need.\n\n[[The next day|PB2]]</div><div tiddler="PB3" tags="" created="201602072049" modifier="twee" twine-position="1130,7010">The following day Chris does not make an appearance until past noon. After a brunch, he decides that an afternoon of swimming and some time in the sauna is the way to go. Chris invites over a load of sycophants and a small party starts. Unfortunately, you are expected to dress the part and you have not brought a bikini. This is not a big problem as Chris has found a bikini for you; albeit, a very skimpy one. \n\nBefore you don the outfit, you visit the bathroom and use some hair removal cream to clean up most of your bush. Quite simply this bikini is much smaller than what you would usually wear down there.&lt;&lt;if $pbs is 4&gt;&gt; As you are removing the hair, you wonder whether Chris will comment when you come out. He has seen your bush and now you are shaving it off for him and his mates, or at least that is how he will see it.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; When you are ready, you make your way down and arrive at the pool in the bikini.\n\n&lt;img src=data/pb9.png&gt;\n\nKnowing that the fabric of your swimsuit will be almost see through if it gets wet, you contemplate whether or not to get in the water and tease the boys or if you should just try and stay dry.\n\n[[Take a dip in the water|PB3A]]\n[[Lay down on the sun lounger|PB3B]]</div><div tiddler="PB2" tags="" created="201602072047" modifier="twee" twine-position="290,7010">You get dressed in your sports gear and head down to the villa to start your self-defence session with Chris.

It starts with some hand-to-hand combat practice, then a fitness session, and then a final practice of all the techniques leant. After he finishes with this, the last part will be to practice them while tired in order to ensure he can react under any circumstance.\n\nThe first part goes well but Chris’s hand does stray a few times and he manages to grope your butt. This takes his attention away from the self-defence and ends up with him being thrown on the floor and winded. This makes Chris focus on the training but his eyes still wander. As you move onto the fitness session, you turn the air conditioning off to make the session more taxing. Before long you are visibly perspiring and Chris, with nowhere near your level of physical training, is dripping buckets.\n\n&quot;Aren’t you a little too hot with that jacket on?&quot; Chris asks through heavy breaths as his eyes clearly focus on your breasts. You know that teasing him will prove advantageous later if you want to plant bugs in the more secure areas. The important thing to decide is how far you plan on letting the teasing go. If you start too heavily or too early, Chris will likely push the situation leading to confrontation or your panties round your ankles.\n\n[[Ignore his remark|PB2A]]\n[[Tease Him by stripping down to your sports bra|PB2B]]</div><div tiddler="CarlaOptionA" tags="" created="201801011456" modifier="twee" twine-position="2950,710">&lt;&lt;goto &quot;Bondage Training&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n&lt;&lt;set $CarlaOption1 to &quot;Pussy Worship&quot;&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $CarlaOption2 to &quot;Orgasm Control&quot;&gt;&gt;  \n&lt;&lt;set $CarlaOption3 to &quot;Anal Training&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n&lt;&lt;set $CarlaOption to &quot;A&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\nOption B\n\n\n\n\n\n</div><div tiddler="CarlaOptionB" tags="" created="201801011456" modifier="twee" twine-position="3090,710">&lt;&lt;goto &quot;Bondage Training&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n&lt;&lt;set $CarlaOption1 to &quot;Orgasm Control&quot;&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $CarlaOption2 to &quot;Pussy Worship&quot;&gt;&gt;  \n&lt;&lt;set $CarlaOption3 to &quot;Anal Training&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n&lt;&lt;set $CarlaOption to &quot;B&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n\n</div><div tiddler="CarlaOptionC" tags="" created="201801011456" modifier="twee" twine-position="3230,710">&lt;&lt;goto &quot;Bondage Training&quot;&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $CarlaOption1 to &quot;Anal Training&quot;&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $CarlaOption2 to &quot;Pussy Worship&quot;&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $CarlaOption3 to &quot;Orgasm Control&quot;&gt;&gt;  \n\n&lt;&lt;set $CarlaOption to &quot;C&quot;&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Int22.8" tags="" created="201609061418" modifier="twee" twine-position="4490,6310">Coming down from your massive public orgasm you are yanked and then nearly dragged off into the alleyways in the back of the Red Light District.

Your legs are spread wide around his hips and you can feel your pussy dripping; clearly it agrees with the Mistress. He drops his pants, presses his cock between your lips, then goes straight to steadily thrusting in and out of you as the gang members cheer him on. He takes his time and your legs lock him in place as you slip into orgasmic bliss. Now in your own little world, he starts roughly fucking you on the dumpster until you feel his cum shoot deep inside of you. \n\n&quot;God, I needed that,&quot; he says as he pulls out of you and steps away. \n\n&lt;img src=data/cob11.png&gt;\n\nWithout his weight holding you up on the dumpster, you slip down until your feet are on the ground and you are leaning against the dumpster.

Carla told you to stop masturbating, and you found it hard to stop, several times, wanting the feeling to hit you so badly.  Like an addict you think to yourself.\n\nSo this is about your own self-control, that was a valuable lesson, but you had to note that Carla was treating you like a //sub//, her sub. Is that you?  You started these sessions to help you with sex, to make you a more kinky sexual predator.  To help you seduce people, Carla is clearly thinking of you as a customer, a long term customer?  Do you want to be her sub? An outlet for stress, or you?  After all the time in the military, do you get off on being dominated?

A few nods and winks about you and Tyrone seems a good bet. You head off and Tyrone holds the door open for you, as you walk through he grabs your ass and gives it a little squeeze to the cheers of the audience. You ignore it and head in, step away from Tyrone and start to get changed.  Tyrone stands there watching you, and you cut him off from his thought pattern;\n\n&quot;Never seen a woman get changed have you, your eyes are on stalks&quot; you tell him, matter of factly.\n\nTyrone stares, looks slightly abashed and then speaks &quot;I thought we had a chance, maybe I can meet you later?&quot;\n\nYou’ve fucked Tyrone once already, but tonight is not his night and you reply; &quot;Not tonight Tyrone, maybe another time&quot;, locking gaze with him, a slightly seductive smile on your face.\n\nTyrone looks disappointed and leaves the room, leaving you slightly disappointed.

There is an unspoken understanding between you and the science staff about what happened to the other test subjects. You wonder briefly to yourself if Xena knew who you were and what you had done and if they pulled strings to make sure you’d become a test subject.\n\nThe two days in the ward pass with no issues and your internal systems tell you that you are ok. Your biggest concern is when the Xena science staff picked up on some of your enhancements. You had to concoct a story about you are enhanced to pass the trials, so a corporation can ultimately score bragging rights on another. This gives the science team something to think about and sets a good bit of banter in place about what they would do if the positions were reversed.

As the event gained popularity, regular shows were put on in the main bar areas and the club began to hire key staff members to act as hostesses. Their main income came from the VIP patrons and a talented hostess could make as much as three month's average salary in a week. After event crowds became overwhelming, the club was renamed as the ‘Shebo Show House’ and was dedicated to the theme.\n\nWord spread and the club was flooded with people wanting to become hostesses.

The job had strict demands of a physical nature; one must be athletic and have good looks, along with a tolerance for pain.\n\nSurprisingly, various groups with planetary and corporate power began to favour hostesses.

The access corridor has a lot of mech security but only one way, to keep what is in the science labs from getting out.

The stores variety of clothing could more aptly be described as the type of costumes you’d find on a film set. You chuckle to yourself as you browse through the selection on display: a sexy stewardess, a ninja, a greek priestess, the classic barbarian heroine, a french maid, and even a sexy sheriff.\n\nWhile you are looking through their stock, a man in his early forties approaches you and strikes up a conversation about some of the items. You make a few nonchalant remarks but are struck by the man’s mesmerizing gaze. You realize you have been lingering in the store for a while, but remember the importance of your mission at hand. As you turn to get up and leave the store the man stops you.\n\nThe man suggests that you should try on one of the outfits before you go. You don’t know why but the man has an air of compulsion and charisma about him that makes you heavily consider his proposition. A part of you does think the outfits look fun... It couldn’t hurt to try on a single one of them, could it? At the very least it would shut the man up and you could be on your way.\n\n[[Try an outfit on|FW1.1]]\n[[Leave anyways|Apartment]]</div><div tiddler="Intel 8 Start" tags="" created="201505091948" modifier="twee" twine-position="4770,3650">As you make your way to the party at the Lounge you reflect on what it at stake here. There are the senior IT management for the planetary core which runs the day to day services needed for a minimalistic planetary government. No doubt most of the people present at the party could get Jane’s records altered given the right incentive. It really depends on whether Xena have shown their interest, which to be fair might make the right incentive quite difficult as whoever carries out the changes could end up dead if it is traced back. \n\nAs normal you get an outfit from Giannio’s and attend the party on your own. You start the evening stood by the bar watching the various factions; the senior IT nerds, the senior flunkies and the management at the top of the planetary Perco food chain. All a bunch of corporate idiots you think to yourself but it is the IT nerds who speak to you first. After a short amount of conversation, it is quite clear that they know who you are and the alcohol loosens tongues and the topic of Shebo comes up. It transpires that there was great excitement in the senior technical leadership when it was told that you had accepted the party invite, their very own ‘Evindium Celebrity’ as the breaker of Shebo records. You almost blush when they talk about your experiences but most of the embarrassment is a cover for your worry about being a ‘celebrity’. \n\nAs you probe the matter you breathe a sigh of relief, Shebo keep the bulk of the material in-house but these guys (and one girl) are the lowest management level accepted at Shebo’s. You snort in amusement as these are the people that the Shebo girls call the space fillers, invited in occasionally when it is clear that an evening could be a little empty, or the quiet week days.  Shebo is one club where it makes it clear that its preferred clientele is the elite, not the uppers and comers, and those that didn’t quite make it to the top. \n\nGossip is what you need, so you join in the banter. The IT ‘nerds’ as you refer to them are quite similar to the military in terms of banter, not so full of the political and refined bullshit of upper executive management team. These people got to their positions by being very ably technically and probably will not get any further unless they learn the art of backstabbing and tough decisions. Losing the human connection, and gaining the corporation and their career comes first. The biggest piece of gossip is that they think their senior manager is going to get the chop soon. They point to her, Sarah Thornton who has a small group with her, her flunkies and sycophants they tell you. Everyone else has abandoned her you are told, like a sinking ship. You ask why and you are told that she got engaged with her boss’s boss, all was going swimmingly until a long-time rival dating from school days got her claws into her fiancée and the relationship broke up. \n\nHelen, her rival is very well connected and seems intent in wreaking Sarah’s life over who knows what. You are told that rumours are suggesting that a reward will be paid for any embarrassing material relating to Sarah. As you digest this information you wonder to yourself to what lengths will an IT executive go to keep their job, your thoughts are interrupted by talk of a bet to get an up-skirt image of Sarah Thornton, apparently, she has a tattoo of a heart with hers and her fiancée’s name just above her pussy. The talk is they doubt she is going commando, but they don’t think the panties will cover the tattoo. Being techies at heart the conversation talks about the angle the shot would need to be taken at to get the tattoo readable.   As you can’t be sacked by Sarah you are asked if you would lift her skirt up so they can get the shots, maybe you could her a wedgie and a kiss at the same time? You don’t answer and instead ask how she was as a boss, it turns out she was ok and quite competent and resisted trimming the department due to its critical role. You tell them you might do it and head over to Sarah Thornton.\n\n[[Speak to Sarah Thornton|Intel8.1]]\n</div><div tiddler="FantasyWear3" tags="" created="201507051855" modifier="twee" twine-position="850,850">You remember coming to this place and buying a pair of stockings, but you lost them!

You're also worried he may have been using illegally modified clothing that slowly weakens the neurological functions of the wearer. There was one recorded case where a small company known as Zentra Inc. worked on a fabric that would allow just that.\n\nThe company was rumored to have released a prototype pair of stockings that made the wearer extremely impressionable and would be dangerous if perfected.

You would be allowed to keep it as compensation if you do.

The second choice means that while you had an opportunity to take care of the guard quickly but chose to have sex instead, adding to your nymphomaniac tendencies and scoring a small increase training.

It all comes to a crashing climax as you scream and your juices splash onto the street below. \n\n&quot;It looks like your time as a slave is almost at an end,&quot; the Mistress tells you as you start to come down from the high of cumming in front of so many people. &quot;You just have to let the rest of the gang make sure you’ve been thoroughly //tested// first.&quot;\n\n[[She leads you away from the crowd|Int22.8]]</div><div tiddler="SH7.3" tags="" created="201804162133" modifier="twee" twine-position="990,3090">Jane is the one that starts it off, by standing up and removing her top, saying she was getting too hot.

Jane asks you to quickly don them before Tyrone arrives, Tyrone is speaking to the owner, apparently a friend of his.\n\nYou get slightly uneasy about this, but Jane tells you that Tyrone does not plan on giving the owner the truth, just asks that it is never spoken of again, it never happened.  \n\nYou quickly get changed and don your jumpsuit, Jane pours you and her a large vodka, followed by bottoms up.

Entry visas are relatively easy to acquire with little to no background checks as long as you could afford the fee and were prepared to submit your personal identification data in the form of retina scans, fingerprints and DNA samples in exchange. Based on the circumstances of your visit you are provided with one of the three levels of Visas:\n\n\n''Level 1'' - Visas reserved for the upper level of corporate staff, their guests, or their families. This grants the owner VIP privileges on the planet.\n\n''Level 2''  - Visas for the non-essential corporate employees and support staff, trading companies doing business with corporations, key local businesses, and other parties in good favour of the main corporations. You were granted a Level 2 Visa due to your cover as a co-pilot for a courier company.\n\n''Level 3'' - Visas offered to immigrants who are prepared to move to and live on the planet as second rate citizens. As Evindium is still largely unpopulated and offers plenty of work, people are willing to give up some of their rights to make a living even if it meant that they might never be allowed to leave the planet.\n\n\nVisas are checked when you enter or exit Space Quarter. You could potentially bypass the security checks using your ship, but that means risking getting caught by the air traffic security services. \n\n&lt;&lt;back&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="NG1.12" tags="" created="201712311104" modifier="twee" twine-position="4630,990">&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=data/jane2.png&gt; &lt;img src=data/jane4.png&gt;\n\n&lt;img src=data/jane3.png&gt; &lt;img src=data/jane1.png&gt; &lt;/center&gt;\n\nThe all new Jane, with no going back......\n\n[[Time to finalize things|NG1.13]]\n\n&lt;&lt;set $JaneChange to 1&gt;&gt;\n</div><div tiddler="Intel17.1" tags="" created="201512212121" modifier="twee" twine-position="4910,5190">When you arrive at the foyer of the apartment block you come to a grand hotel like entrance.

You are taken to an ornate Eastern style indoor garden where you meet a sickly looking Asian man in his fifties.  Lina is nowhere in sight and you are offered a chair by the usher. Hu Chung gestures for you to sit down next to him on a raised platform at the edge of the garden. After a pleasant exchange of formalities Hu, Chung gets down to business.\n \n&quot;I understand that you are very gifted with the sword and have extensive genetic modifications.

My informants tell me you have done other things as well. You are here for something and I think you are here to kill someone&quot; he states in a curt tone.\n \nAgain you are noncommittal and Hu Chung starts to talk about himself. His father was leader of the Dragon Gang and helped shape it to become the challenging force it is now. When Hu Chung’s elder brother was killed he thought that he would follow his father as the next leader. Instead Hu Chung ended up running a portion of the gambling businesses and rackets the Dragon Gang ran. It was said that a new dynamic and up and coming leader was needed as Hu Chung was considered too much of a ‘figures man’ to take the Dragon Gang forward. As it happens, Hu Chung is now seen as a successful and legitimate business man and really has been side-lined as he has not been invited to the operational meetings of the Dragon Gang for a number of years.\n \n[[Hu continues his story|Intel17.2]]</div><div tiddler="Nick5A3" tags="" created="201703162122" modifier="twee" twine-position="2810,1970">With the strip build up and the solid fucking in both your holes it takes little time before you reach a screaming orgasm, muffled by the gag.

It was fucking painful on my legs and pussy lips, to say the least. It’s done though; I passed their test&quot; you say.\n\n&quot;Wow, Celeste. I'm impressed but if I'm captured I'll probably end up on something like that until my pussy rips,&quot; Jane groans.\n\n&quot;Nah, you will lose value as a fuck slave if that happens. Come on, Jane. We both know they will sell you into a whorehouse if you are caught. After a thorough interrogation, of course,&quot; you cheerfully mention.\n\n&quot;You are one fucked up bitch sometimes, Celeste.

How long do you think I have got before I am found here?&quot; Jane asks in a worried tone.\n\n&quot;Jane, to Xena the information is long gone. They won't be looking too hard as the agents on the ground are never told much and there is no gain in capturing us as we don't know anything. Still, we don’t want to draw the interest of the planetary security forces as we both know that anyone involved in the 'ambush' plan is going to be extremely ticked off with us. If they are even still alive, of course,&quot; you state knowing that whoever claimed the Evictor ambush was fool proof has probably been terminated from their job, quite literally.\n\n&quot;But how many days?&quot; Jane carries on.\n\n&quot;I really have no idea, but you sit tight.  I will try and get you out of the hangar as soon as possible.  Maybe I could fly the Magnum to a repair yard?&quot; you suggest to Jane.\n\nJane laughs &quot;You know, Celeste, I'm sure you would be capable of flying the Magnum if there wasn’t air traffic and you didn't have to worry about getting shot up if you pass any security forces. There are better ways of committing suicide than that, but I will admit if you could get me in and out of the hangar, that would be great,&quot; Jane reminds you.\n\n&quot;OK, Jane. I will see if I can get you out for a bit. Maybe I can get a ship to fly in close to the roof,&quot; you say thinking to yourself about how to manage such a feat.\n\n&quot;Please be serious, Celeste! If they lock the hangar doors I’ll have nowhere to run. I already have the ship locked down and a gun by my side all the times.&quot; \n\nYou take note that Jane is stuck in a complex with no escape routes. It can't be good for her mental health just sitting there, but if you get her out can you get her back in again?\n\nYou carry on your conversation with Jane a little while longer until she has calmed down and the conversation trails off.\n\n[[You have to hurry up and save her|Apartment]] &lt;&lt;set $Event to 2&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="RPool6A" tags="" created="201701032147" modifier="twee" twine-position="6450,1130">No Content\n\n&lt;&lt;back&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="CutScene3" tags="" created="201707121005" modifier="twee" twine-position="6030,150">__Evindium Prime City Outskirts__\n\nNo-one ran to help the man limping in from the deep desert, it was clear that his leg was busted and probably quite a bit else.

Sid never really spoke to her after Celeste had been recruited, a moment that still haunted Jane.\n\nJane was approached several years back by a member of Sid’s organisation, who worked on her to recruit military special forces personnel. It was good money and it took a while for her to decide to recruit Celeste. Celeste was different a friend, and Jane decided to leave the military as well.  Sid was displeased, Jane always assumed that it was because he would have to recruit another insider. Either way Sid never really spoke to her much, Sid dealt with Celeste.\n\nSo, why was Sid calling her, over Celeste? Jane would know shortly; “Hello” she quietly answered.\n\n“Hello Jane”, came the response, “I need you to do something for me, well for Celeste” came the demand.\n\nJane nearly laughed out loud, it was always for Celeste, she understood why, skillsets and all, but sometimes it got to her. “I think Celeste is doing things for me?” Jane replied, knowing the response would drag an explanation from Sid.\n\n“I’m going to cut to the point Jane, our psychologists and analysts have drawn up an extensive report on psychological trauma to Celeste based on expected encounters……..”\n\n“Just get to it Sid” Jane cut in, sounding a little irritated.\n\n“Well, we thinking killing and sexual trauma is to be expected, you need to support her Jane, offer no judgement, laugh it off maybe, bit of camaraderie. But no soul searching or analysis of actions, and do not be overly negative” Sid offered, more of a command really.\n\n“So you are saying if Celeste, if Celeste starts going a bit nuts, I should grin and bear it?”  Jane slowly confirms back.\n\n“Yes, Celeste will likely work with dangerous criminal organisations, will likely offer sex for advancement, will take demeaning roles where sex is on the cards and could well murder people in cold blood, deserving people but still murder” Sid says all matter of fact and continues “Our psychologists say Celeste will cope better if you go along with it, maybe encourage her from time to time, keep her spirts up and all that” Sid finishes off, sounding quite confident.\n\n“Why? Jane asks, wanting more of an explanation.\n\n“So you have noticed that Celeste has been getting a little more sexually active recently, maybe a little more deviant, little more out there? Look the other day she was boasting of fucking two men into the ground after a night clubbing, you remember?” Sid continues.\n\n“Ok, ok, I get it. I will support you, just get your shrinks to send some reports on how I should react to certain events” Jane agrees.\n\n“Will do, Jane, we want you both out of here, and Celeste in the right mental shape, remember she is on the planet still for you, and you need to stay strong for her. We reckon you will both get off, before we could come to rescuing you, it will be ok, you will be fine, just stay out of sight” Sid finishes.\n\n“Right, Jane out” says Jane breaking off the call.\n\nAs Jane pondered the call she was aware of the reports arriving, a whole set of essays. Jane got it, the cost of the reports was not even close to the fee for a successful infiltration mission. Sid wanted his merchandise back. There was one thing troubling Jane, that was the changes to Celeste before arriving on planet, Sid was right, Celeste was someone who rarely drank and got laid. Now Celeste was bit of a party girl, a bit of flashing, public or group sex was ok.\n\nJane had joined in as well, but she wasn’t as keen as Celeste, nor wanted to push the boundaries even more. She suspected that Celeste was getting a thrill in pushing the boundaries even more, and Jane wanted to talk to her about it. But Sid’s advice, Sid’s professional advice was not too. The thing is, this impacted on Jane’s life as well, she was scared, dying was one thing, but being actively hunted, when on your own was something different. It was like being prey.\n\nShit, Jane thought to herself, this was one fucked up mission, with a good chance that if it went well, Celeste would be one fucked up cookie.\n\n[[Next|Apartment]]\n\n&lt;&lt;set $Event to 3&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="RockGym1.1A" tags="" created="201612311014" modifier="twee" twine-position="850,2390">You give Rock Lobster a little flirtatious wink to say you understood the question and to hint of later things.

The skipping is so he can get a good side and front view of your tits bouncing upside down, and the stretching when you are in various stretches that are similar to sexual positions. You can tell you are having an impact on the man as he keeps adjusting his shorts, his package must be fighting the strain. \n\nWhen the fight starts, you go in light and defensively, letting Rock make the moves. While he does go easy on you he does not pick the best tactics against you. At the start you blew a little kiss at him, part mocking and part enticement, those outside the ring who were not watching you both warm up would have thought you were mocking Rock. Either way Rock is uncertain, he wants to give you a public beating but his thoughts have moved past focussing on the fight but on how he is going to fuck you. After two minutes of fighting it is all over, a good solid hook has floored Rock Lobster and the referee is counting him out. Rock manages to get up, but he is dazed and you go all in on him and punch him around the ring. Rock goes down another two times until he stays down.\n\nYou give him time to recover and stand by his side, when he is about to get up you tell him to stay down. Rock complies and you slip your fight shorts and underwear off leaving you naked on the lower half. Grinning devilishly at a tricked Rock you step over him and kneel over his face, to complete the domination you trap his arms with your lower leg over his biceps. In position, you lower your pussy over his face and gyrate, smearing your juices over his face, marking him as yours. Then comes the command that you are not getting off until he makes you orgasm, Rock starts licking and it does not get you long to forget about the audience and indulge in your pleasure.  After a haze of pleasure, you orgasm on Rock’s face, sighing and panting for a minute you then climb off him, pick up your panties and shorts and head off the changing rooms. You glance over your shoulder and see a shocked gym mate pass a now sitting Rock a towel. Going to need more than that to get the smell of his face you think; a good scrub is what he needs.\n\nWhen you have finished getting changed you head out, Rock is not in sight but the gym mood is hostile. While most missed your warm up antics, some did not and the audience is generally hostile.

Now that was a woman that Hugo wanted to kill slowly, during the slow hobble through the desert Hugo had thought of ways to kill Blake painfully. \n\nThe thought was the only thing holding Hugo’s sanity together, with the critical damage inflicted to his body the cyborg components took other, removing what little comfort blanket of human senses and feelings left to Hugo.

You beat him once and you can do it again, but a voice inside your head is saying you are kidding yourself and you just to be beaten and ravished. Why else are you here? You tell Rock that if he thinks he is going to win he has another thing coming and head off into a warm up, the referee gives you both 15 minutes and the rest of the gym slowly stop what they are doing to get the best spots around the ring.\n\nWhen the 15 minutes are up you head off to start the fight. Rock looks focussed and intent, in the fighters zone and when the match starts it shows. Rock Lobster is a better fighter than you, and stronger, you have an edge in speed and reaction time but Rock has learnt that and is staying in close where your quicker reaction time does not save you totally.  While he takes some serious punishment in taking the fight into close quarters, any one of the grapple situations could end the match. As it is a knee strike takes your head down and into a front chokehold, you tap out before you pass out, when Rock releases you fall to the floor and land on your hands and knees. Rock holds you there by grabbing your hair. Giving it a pull he lifts you up slightly to show the audience and shouts;\n\n“Told you I could beat the bitch easily, this is a loser who is going to give some appreciation to my cock”\n\nWith that he lets go of your hair and you fall back onto your knees, you are then told to strip out of your fighter’s clothes and looking round you know you have no choice. You climb to your feet wanting to be seen as strong and unembarrassed and pull your clothes on as if no-one was there, Rock seems to enjoy this and shouts out to everyone that you feel no shame, are not embarrassed and truly is a slut! That causes you to stop, and a feeling of embarrassment washes over you, here you are in front of a gym full of men and woman fighters and you are in the ring unclasping your sports bra. Rock laughs and you remove your bra, feeling less certain now. Standing there topless in your fighters shorts rock gives a breast a squeeze as you pull down your shorts and panties together. \n\nWhen you are naked Rock grabs you by the arse and tells you that you need to do a lap around the ring, being pushed by your arse you do a lap around the ring, faced with laughs and jeers. When you are finished, you are guided to the middle and told to kneel. You do as you are told and Rock pulls his hard member out and sticks it by your face, just far enough away so you will have to lean forwards to suck it. You pause in indecision and then take his member, the excitement of Rock, or your skills means that it does not take long to bring Rock off and he takes great delight in pulling out and spurting over your tits and face, when you go to wipe it off Rock kneels down next you and grabs your wrists:\n\n“None of that, you are wearing it until you hit the showers. If you want a rematch you will have to undergo another challenge, otherwise walk out of here knowing you got well and truly used”, with that Rock lets go and heads off to the changing rooms. Looking round you see the crowd disperse back to doing other things, though there are a few hangers around and when you grab your clothes you get a few comments. You trudge off back to the changing rooms, shower and get into your jumpsuit. Why the hell did you try this out you wonder to yourself, no gain, time wasted and you got to suck cock in front of everyone. You are not going to go back after this, are you?\n\n[[Return to Apartment|Apartment]]\n&lt;&lt;set $Days to $Days + 0.5&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $RockGym to 2&gt;&gt;\n</div><div tiddler="CF7B" tags="" created="201507301517" modifier="twee" twine-position="710,4630">You play the stamina game and endure his relentless assault. After a quite a few times where he had swept you off your feet, nearly knocked you out, or tried to pin you, your chance final comes to take the upper hand. Rock Lobster gets slower and you notice his breathing becoming more ragged. You up your game and pulling on the reserves you gained from long missions out in the field and pounce. \n\nYour opportunity comes with a leg sweep that manages to knock him over. When he is getting up, a kick to the solar plexus stuns and shakes him. When he stands, two solid punches sets him up for a jump kick that knocks him to the floor with a thud that shakes the ring. \n\n&lt;img src=data/cage81.png&gt; &lt;img src=data/cage80.png&gt;\n\nWhen he doesn't get up and is clearly unconscious, you are declared the victor. You smile grimly as your ribs ache, possibly broken, and you are covered in bruises. Now you are a cage fighting queen that may even end up ranked in the top tier after this performance. You doubt you would want to face someone like Rock Lobster again, as without further specialized training or modifications, it would probably end differently.\n\nYour slight humiliation of Rock Lobster is a victory pose, with your foot on top of his muscular back. This is a win you will treasure for some time.\n\n&lt;img src=data/cage82.png&gt;\n\nIt has been a positive evening, though. You have won your hardest match, gained some more credits, and after you finish your shower you can walk out of here like a champion.\n\n\n\nYou can’t wait to get back to your apartment before collapsing with a groan into your sofa!\n\n[[Mission Debrief|Mission 3 Debrief]] &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Credits += 800&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Mental = $Mental - 0.5&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Rock to 1&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="CF7C" tags="" created="201507301518" modifier="twee" twine-position="850,4630">The guy is a machine as he chases you around the ring while launching a flurry of quick attacks that better your defences. It all comes to an ends when you are thrown to the floor following a savage knee strike.  On your back and slightly stunned you can't defend against a torrent of solid blows. You feel these crash down on your body and head until darkness descends upon you. \n\n&lt;img src=data/cage74.png&gt; &lt;img src=data/cage75.png&gt;\n\nWhen you come to after a couple of seconds, you find Rock Lobster astride you with a hand around your throat. \n\n&quot;You quit?&quot; he asks, the answer obvious.\n\nYou feel a moment of rage and go to hit him. To his credit, Rock tightens his grip around your throat and raises his fist ready. This brings you to your senses that that the fight is lost, and you raise your hands in surrender.\n\n&lt;img src=data/cage76.png&gt;\n\nWhen he sees the fight is won, he just lets go of your throat where you collapse on the floor in the same place. The bell rings and signals his victory. Rock strikes a victory pose as you lie there recovering from the punishment you took.\n\n&lt;img src=data/cage77.png&gt;\n\nWhen he gets off you, you pull yourself together and get ready to get off the floor, you wonder whether Rock Lobster is going to take advantage of you or not.

I'll need to restrain you since I'm sure your climax is going to be explosive,&quot; she tells you while helping you up.\n\nYour legs wobble slightly on the short walk to the chair and you plop down. While Carla secures your wrist and ankles, you close your eyes and try to ease your nerves. Your entire body is hypersensitive and every thought laced with sexuality when you don't focus your mind. You finally start to relax when you feel something press up against your pussy. You fail to stifle a moan as your eyes jolt open and you look down to see her securing a wireless massaging wand in place between your legs.\n\n&quot;Carla, you wou- AaaaAaAAAaaAaahhhhhhhh. Fuck.

At one point you believe Carla starts masturbating while watching you cum your brains out, but you can't keep your head clear long enough to tell. After what feels like hours' worth of intense love making in strain and pleasure, she finally switches the wand off.\n\n&quot;Feels like you just got gangbanged, eh?&quot; Carla says to try and lighten the mood as she offers you a bottle of water. &quot;You need this. You easily squirted this much while you were cumming.&quot;\n\nYou finish the bottle in a hurry and Carla helps you dress yourself before seeing you to the door.\n\n&quot;Don't let yourself become addicted to that much pleasure at once,&quot; she teases while opening the door.\n\nYou never would... right?\n\n</div><div tiddler="CF7A" tags="" created="201507301520" modifier="twee" twine-position="430,4630">You wait with with a disinterested pose and expression.

A hint of a smile plays across his face as he thinks he has unsettled you. Maybe he has, maybe, just maybe that may work to your advantage.  \n\nYou want to come out of this fight with your head held high, the only way for that to happen is to win. If you don't win, you can guess what is going to happen.

Eh, Celeste?&quot; she asks with a grin.\n\nYou aren’t sure how you feel about being called a ‘pet’ and have visions of being chained in a dungeon where Carla gets a premium for selling you, the thought sends a shudder of suppressed excitement down your spine. You decide you want to experience... suffering.... the pet needs to be disciplined you think to yourself, liking the sounding of the words.\n\n&quot;May I please experience another lesson in the joys of suffering for you, Mistress?&quot; you ask her calmly.\n\n&quot;Suffering how, my pet?&quot; she asks looking down at you with a smirk.\n\n&quot;Please strike me, Mistress,&quot; you solemnly plead.\n\n&quot;Ah. Of course, my pet. We won't even need to leave my office this time. Stand and close the door for sounds sake. You are then to walk over to the spanking table in the corner and lie down face first while I restrain you,&quot; she orders you.\n\n&quot;Yes, Mistress,&quot; you offer in acknowledgement and stand then close the door.\n\nYou walk over to the spanking table which is an imposing device to say the least. You lay yourself across it on your stomach, your face coming to rest in a support no dissimilar to that included with a massage table. Carla stretches your arms forward across two padded planks that shoot out in a 'V' and prevent you from fighting back or turning over.  Lastly, though your feet still touch the ground from the tables height, your ankles are secured a few feet apart by an attached spreader bar that gives her immediate access to every inch of your flesh from behind.\n\nCarla walks away from the table and you can hear her rummaging through her drawers which makes your heart race. You wonder what splendid tortures she has in store for you today. You hear her set something by on a nearby table then starts hitting the palm of her hand with something else.\n\n&quot;You remember your safe word, my pet?&quot; she whispers unexpectedly in your ear, her warm breath making your skin crawl.

These things are like living out a vivid, and often very wet, dream. Modules like these were very popular ten or so years back until it was discovered living out such realistic, kinky dreams over and over left some people a little unhinged.

Your head is throbbing and you just want to leave so you can rest and recover already. You pull off your gloves, t-shirt, sports bra, shorts, and panties, then stand completely naked in front of the Rock Lobster.

The vessel is registered under a small interstellar courier company shell corporation. Officially, Jane and Celeste are registered as a pilot and co-pilot employed by the company.\n\nThe Magnum is a commercial version of a small military utility ship. She has been fitted with a small caliber cannon, guided missiles, and a military grade navigation system. The vessel is equipped with a full range of sensors and is suited for a variety of missions.\n\nWith a spaceplane design, the Magnum is capable of manoeuvres in atmosphere. This provides a huge advantage for Celeste as a lot of the equipment she uses would never make it past the customs or security checks used in public transport. The high tech equipment and other ‘contraband’ are stored in a hidden compartment behind the extra fuel tanks.\n\nThe downside was that the ship, with all its modifications, did not come in cheap. Adding in fuel costs, maintenance, weapons permits, and the occasional bribe to local authorities when necessary, and Celeste was left with a good few years’ worth of missions before she would be able to enjoy her wealth.  As it stands the ship is three-quarters of the way paid off and the rest is owned by a bank. All of this in spite of the fact the Magnum was even purchased second hand.\n\n&lt;&lt;back&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="MaxStatus1.1" tags="" created="201705011055" modifier="twee" twine-position="990,3370">You discuss this with Max, the current position is that all the girls were too far gone, apart from Sarah. They are now working with Max's people on basic tasks, but also earning some money working in a small brothel. You ask why, and are told that the girls are conditioned to want sex really bad, if they are left without they will go around begging for it. \n\nYou decide that it seems fairly harmless and the Cobra's are providing protection and the money is helping subsidise Max's operation. \n\nThe next thing is about the facilities continued operation. \n\n&lt;&lt;if $Carla is 1&gt;&gt;You and Max both agree that Carla would be a good candidate to run the place. You just need to get her onboard. \n\n&lt;&lt;back&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;elseif $Carla is 2&gt;&gt;You give Carla a call and give her a tour, first you show her the nearly finished product, then the facility and then get her to meet some of the imprisoned guards who used to carry out the training. You have also acquired a lot of the training manuals for the process involved, apparently, it is sold as a black-market package.\n\nCarla is shocked, but somewhat thrilled. This is how the big boys operate she tells you, when you think about it, she is right. This is at the high end of the market, fully trained sex slaves for the really wealthy. Carla deals with the junior professionals, not the high execs. The only thing Carla wants to know is where are you going to sell the 'merchandise' and how you will acquire new stock. Now it is your turn to be shocked. Carla has taken to this like a moth to a flame;\n\n&quot;My enemies&quot; you reply, making Carla go quiet.\n\nBefore long it is agreed, Carla will run the facility and split her time between it and her domme studio. Carla has a girl in mind to take over most of the day to day domme duties. You think it will work, and give it your blessing. \n\n[[Return to Apartment|Apartment]]\n\n&lt;&lt;set $Carla to 3&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Mission7Outcome to 2&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n</div><div tiddler="FM1" tags="" created="201711222033" modifier="twee" twine-position="150,6450">The journey across the Evindium desert is uneventful, so is the descent into the mine.  Now here you are 500m from where the ventilation shaft connects to the mine.  While you are there you wonder why they would have a ventilation shaft into a mine? Why not directly to the surface?  Maybe hidden away, disguised as a rock or something.  There would be better air at the surface, though the miners did pump air into the mines to make life easier for the staff.\n\nOne thing you did question is why the mine was abandoned, you expect that the answer will be a senior corporation decision (influenced by Xena) but you are told it was down to miners refusing to come down into the mine, due to people disappearing. You ask Maddock’s men whether they are pissing with you, but they tell you they are deadly serious, that they would not lie when you are undertaking a mission like this.  As you think it over, you decide there is no coincidence here, it must be something to do with the Xena facility.  You ask what happened to the miners but are told that no bodies were ever found.\n\nIt seems strange to be getting into your infiltration suit again, you expect a lot of security technology at the air vents, once past there it looks like security will be quite light.  But the schematics could give the wrong impression.  Being naked and changing near Maddock’s men brings some excitement to you, but this is weighed down by the mission ahead and the missing miners.  As normal you are going in with no weapons, as infiltration proof weapons are no good against a mech or other robotic sentry, invisibility to their sensors is the only safety net.\n\nWhen you are ready you go over the extraction points with Maddock’s guys and hope that the security will be fairly low key down there.

Governments and corporations were quick to sponsor massive, jump capable colony ships.\n\nAs the colonists populated a series of beachhead worlds, the construction of a network of Jumpgates began. While jump capable ships could be afforded only by the largest corporations and planetary governments, Jumpgates opened the interstellar commerce to everyone at a reasonable price.\n\nMost of the interstellar traffic turned out to be less like the shining future portrayed in sci-fi films and more a case of hauling a big rig or flying economy in the twentieth century; only the rich could afford private ships. The general population could still afford short holidays on other planets, but most never have the opportunity to leave the planet of their birth.\n\n&lt;&lt;back&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Intel8.1B" tags="" created="201612292210" modifier="twee" twine-position="5190,3650">You get right in front of Sarah and kneel down, Sarah looks at you questioningly and you push your arm up under her dress and to get the right look of shock of her face you rub her pantied covered pussy jolting her and giving her a shocked face. Following that you lift her dress up until the start of the tattoo is revealed, just enough for it to be seen but probably not enough for the writing to be revealed. Sarah pushes down with her arms to get you to release the bottom of the dress and you let go and stand up. \n\nSarah then runs off towards the toilets. You find yourself in a room of shocked execs who are afraid of their boss enough not to cheer, but clearly enjoyed the spectacle. You make your way out of the party and take a few numbers, you may need to call in a simple bribe if things go wrong with Sarah.\n\nAn hour later you are invited to Helen’s party by a third party, some of the IT execs posted a few images of the Shebo girl and an embarrassed Sarah Thornton. \n\n[[Return to Apartment|Apartment]]\n&lt;&lt;set $Mis4 to &quot;True&quot;&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Int8 to &quot;Complete&quot;&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="NG1.10B" tags="" created="201712302341" modifier="twee" twine-position="4070,990">You tell her that maybe you would, maybe you wouldn’t, the woman laughs and increases the fingering of your pussy.\n\n“There is no maybe, you are a slut, sluts are a creature of the moment, pleasure now, pain later, of course the hotel has to notice that you are late, they may not”.\n\nTrying to ignore the pleasure shooting through your body you know the woman is playing a game with you, she knows the hotel rules, knows that if you stay too long you might be punished.  Stay and you will be fucked silly, and you might get a reward from her, for providing extraordinary service.  Or she could say you were an absolute slut………\n\nDecisions, decisions, by now the woman has got up from the sofa and is caressing your tits from the outside of your outfit, while the other hand plays with your dripping pussy.  Your eyes are on the woman on the bed, being ploughed, you are aware as the woman beckons the watching men over and don’t say anything, submitting to the inevitable.  She tells them to have one go in all of your holes and be quick about it.\n\nYou find yourself being led to the bed and told to straddle one man, you take his cock in your wet pussy and start to ride him, still wearing your maid outfit, another man bends you forwards and starts probing your ass, soon a cock slides in there.  The third man shoves his cock in your face, where you eagerly take it.  The men follow their instructions and the first to cum is the one fucking your pussy, followed at nearly the same time as face and ass man.   \n\n“Get the slut out the room” commands the woman and you find yourself being carried to the door, spunk running down your legs, you managed to swallow most of the mouth load, but your face is still a mess.

It is a deep red, top to bottom, including an overstuffed couch and armchair. The only thing that isn't red are a pair of white lampshades that allow a warm light to permeate the room. As you hear the door close behind you, Carla lays back on the couch and spreads her legs wide open and undoes her robe.\n\nUnderneath the thin garment, Carla had change into a very risqué pair of black, lace lingerie. Her bra was a push up with a wonderful floral design and she was wearing a pair of matching black, crotchless panties that highlighted her wet lips.

Her fingers are soon replaced by a cock sliding into your wet hole. The slight shock makes you try to stand up but you are pinned against the pool table. Carla now sits by your side with a big grin across her face.\n\nBefore long you are back to leaning on the pool table as Lenny fucks you harder and harder. As he finally cums inside of you, you let out a load moan that was likely heard throughout most of the pool hall. As you start to come down from the pleasure, you notice by this time that there is a small crowd of onlookers and a mixture of shame and wanton lust fills you. As Lenny pulls out you know that another of his crew has positioned himself to take Lenny’s place and within seconds your cunt is filled again. The public fucking resumes and you orgasm loudly brining a cheer from the watchers.\n\nTime goes on and you are fucked by another two men over the pool table. When you remove yourself from the pool table you see that most of the spunk has either dripped onto your panties or is caked down the inside of your legs. You can’t wear your panties since they are flooded with cum, so you kick them off and walk off to the toilets with a trail of cum dripping from between your legs. As you walk off, the roars and cries of the crowd echo behind you and Lenny slaps your butt and invites you back if you ever want a good fuck.\n\nWhile you are in the toilets cleaning yourself up, Carla comes in and congratulates you and tells you that she won her wager. You ask how that’s possible and what the wager even was in the first place. Carla replies that the wager was whether or not she could train a girl into being a submissive fuck slut who gets off on public sex. With that she slaps your ass and said that you know you loved it as you feel a fresh wetness in your pussy.

With a few final flicks of your tongue, you feel the receptionist’s weight sink into your shoulders as her juices squirt all over your face. \n\nAfter a moment the receptionist finally relaxes and lets out a deep breath of contentment.

You notice the cold cum tastes even more bitter than before as your tongue diligently traces between her toes, sure not to miss a single drop. Once you finish, she presses her foot into your chest and wipes it dry before bringing it to rest on your leg.\n\n&quot;Now gently use your finger to get the cum up from my heel,&quot; she says sternly. &quot;Those are freakin' limited edition Lenní Vuson heels and I doubt you have the money to get me another pair.

You pick up her heel and use the tip of your finger to get up the cum before it has a chance to set. You take your finger and suck the thick glop of cum off your finger bringing an end to your humiliation. You slide the receptionist’s heel back onto her foot and are finally allowed to stand back up as she fixes her skirt before walking off.\n\nWhen she turns the corner, you contemplate what you've just done.

You have always had an exhibitionist side to you, but there have been limits and today you have crossed the line big time for your induction. \n\nYou think you are getting your way when one of the men offers to spot for you, he talks to you without looking at your tits which is good, though you have caught him having a peak previously. Maybe he is trying to make amends? The bench-pressing spotting goes well, working on small sets of your maximum weight, you are even blissfully unaware that your spread legs on the sides of the bench have really accentuated your pussy lips, then the situation goes downhill. The guy refuses to pull the weight back up at the end of the set though he does take some of the weight.\n\n“Better beg baby, or you are going to be crushed” he leers trying to get a rise out of you. \n\nBefore you say anything, another man has come over and is running his finger down your visible pussy crack, sending a shiver through you. What do you do?\n\n[[Groan and beg|RockGym2.2A1]]\n[[Tell him to stop being a twat and kick out at the other one|RockGym2.2A2]]\n</div><div tiddler="RockGym2.2B" tags="" created="201612311049" modifier="twee" twine-position="2250,2390">You decide to hit the bags and after an hour of hard sweaty work you are hacked off with the whole thing. This outfit, challenging Rock to a re-match, all pointless. You do feel slightly proud in some ways; firstly, you agreed to this childish and sexist challenge and completed it with no issue, and secondly because at first it felt like you were acting out one of your fantasies, being a gym slut. \n\nThis time you acted out your fantasy and did not let it turn into a porn movie. Your thoughts of satisfaction do come to an end when you walk through the gym and see that the pants have almost gone see through......\n\nYour //what the fuck// moment ends when you realise that the pants react to heat. Your hard sweaty workout has given the gym members an almost naked Celeste to stare at. Fucking perverts you think to yourself and a flush hits your cheeks, noticed by most of the gym when they enjoy the expression on your face from working out the situation with the pants. The gym is totally silent as you carry out your walk of shame to the showers.\n\nAs you contemplate events, naked in the shower you come to the conclusion that you were totally a gym slut. The thought excites you and your hands wander over your body, finding themselves glued to your favourite spot. You find yourself playing with your pleasure nub and are taken out of your trance when another girl joins you in the communal shower.\n\n&quot;Got off on your display eh?&quot; she interrupts you. You glance over, and see the tattooed muscular girl apprising you.\n\n&quot;Rock says you get off on these things, thinks you fight yourself, messed up character. I think he is right, impressed with your fighting though&quot; with that the girl starts to wash herself, knowing that your gaze is on her body and your hand still between your legs. Too far gone you climax and give a little groan. When you come down you quickly finish in the shower and wonder about the girls words.\n\n[[Return to Apartment|Apartment]]\n&lt;&lt;set $RockGym to 3&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Days to $Days + 0.5&gt;&gt;\n</div><div tiddler="Carla4B" tags="" created="201805262320" modifier="twee" twine-position="2950,570">&quot;Did being denied leave a strong impression on you?&quot; she asks in partial jest. &quot;I look forward showing you how much more there is to control than just edging and denial.

I'll say your underwear is... optional, but it will likely get messy if you keep it on.&quot;\n\nYou're intrigued and aroused by her vague hints of what she has planned and decide it best to strip yourself entirely. You sit down on the bench and Carla sits down beside you and starts running her hands up and down your exposed left side.\n\n&quot;You're such a beautiful woman. I hope you know that, Celeste,&quot; she says while her eyes trace your curves and her hand slides down to your leg and softly parts it. &quot;It's a real treat to have someone as strong as you choose to serve me.&quot; Carla leans in over you and plants a lingering kiss on your neck that makes your entire body relax for her. She wastes no time sliding two fingers into your now slick pussy and plants a second kiss underneath your ear and whispers, &quot;Thank you,&quot; as she curls them.\n\nThe unexpected rawness of Carla's passion and the frankness in her words cut through any guard you had up and you soon find her playing your body like a cello. The bliss of the moment overcomes you and part of you knows she could ask you do anything in this moment and you doubt you'd be able to say no. Her fingers slip and rub all the right spots and you know it won't be much longer until your tipping point. You clench your toes, close your eyes, and grip the bench when she rips her fingers out and your left short of breath and climax.\n\n&quot;That's one,&quot; she tells you, her words dripping with a sadistic glee. &quot;Only nine more to go.&quot;\n\n[[Accept your fate|OrgasmControl2A]]</div><div tiddler="SC9" tags="" created="201512222033" modifier="twee" twine-position="7850,570">//Agreeing to meet the girlfriend of a man she just met on the off chance of some joint sex training is 'adventurous' of Celeste, to say the least.//\n\nYour ''Training'' has increased by 1% and your ''Submission'' has increased by 2% because you were willingly taken advantage of.</div><div tiddler="Random Rl9B.1" tags="" created="201602110353" modifier="twee" twine-position="5610,5610">You drag all four into the cell and search around for the key to this old fashioned door lock.

All the guards have plastic cuffs on them and you have fun positioning their bodies. Two of them are left restrained to chairs at opposite ends of the table. One is cuffed spread eagle to the table, his arms and legs restrained to the table’s legs. The last you cuff with his arms behind his back, leaving him hooked to a chain and collar you find.  You then stand back and admire your work for a long few seconds and decide something is missing: their briefs.\n \nYou go outside the room and pull out their briefs from the guard’s uniform and put them on their heads. You then close the room’s door and lock the room, leaving the light on for the guards’ benefit when they come around. You then search the corridor and find a drainage duct large enough to stuff the uniforms,  stun batons, and other equipment down; no-one will check that in a hurry and they will need a cleaning robot to get the stuff out again. You keep one of the guard’s access cards and let yourself out the way you entered.\n \n//Now to get them sacked...// \n\nYou press the fire alarm button and scream fire as you exit into the station. It appears there is only one station member of staff on duty and in the chaos you choke the poor woman unconscious. This metro is low tech and needs a certain amount of human input to function properly. When the alarm is not cancelled after ninety seconds, fire suppressant foam starts to squirt out all over the station. All trains are stopped and the Perco supplied fire department is summoned.\n \nYou head out of the station and chuckle to yourself as you picture what the firefighters will find when they smash down the door in the station basement. You drop the key for the shackles and the basement door into the crowd of people when you leave.\n\nYou are sure that after an investigation, those men will be fired and guard standards will be more heavily enforced as more customer complaints come forward.\n \n[[Get to your destination|$RLdest]] &lt;&lt;set $RLR to 10&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="CF3D1" tags="Stat_29" created="201601290338" modifier="twee" twine-position="2390,4490">Still keeping you pinned, the wrester pulls his hand from your pussy and proceeds to stand up.\n\n&quot;Stay lying there and pull off your shorts and panties.

He looms over you as he pulls off his trunks to reveal a hardening monster of a cock. When his trunks are pulled off he throws them so that they land on your head. \n\n&quot;Open your cunt lips for me and beg for a good fucking,&quot; he barks at you.\n\nKnowing you have no choice, you do as you are told and holding open your pussy lips as you begin to beg. Humiliation and arousal both run through you, mixed with a certain amount of shame. How could it have come to this?\n\nThe man wastes no time and kneels down between your spread legs and guides his cock towards your waiting snatch. With a little force, the head of his cock pushes through. He slowly thrusts his cock in and out of you until he slides into you balls deep.\n\nYou gasp at the size and you nearly cum from the sensation of his cock filling you alone. Soon your voice has turned to regular moans as he pistons his cock back and forth. The fairly gentle insertion soon turns into a rough missionary fucking until you squeal out as you orgasm. You convulsing pussy finally proves too much for him and this is soon followed by him squirting a large load inside of you. \n\nAs he climbs off, he tells you to spend the remainder of the humiliation round with your legs spread and spunk seeping from your gaping pussy. This is only made worst by his pair of sweaty trunks still resting over your head. The shame and humiliation of being publically fucked and the fact that you loved it burns deep inside your mind. \n\nWhen the punishment bell sounds indicating that the time is up, you get yourself to your feet and walk towards the exit without bothering to redress. The wrestler has already gone in a triumphant style and a part of you finds it only fitting that you trudge off, half naked, with spunk dripping down your leg.\n\n[[Recover before the next fight|CF4]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC29&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Training = $Training + 1&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Mental = $Mental + 2&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $CF3D to 1&gt;&gt; \n&lt;&lt;set $Wrestler to 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="CF5A" tags="" created="201610022017" modifier="twee" twine-position="2950,4490">You are on her in a split second and Kat tries to put up a fight, but dazed by the kick her attacks are feeble and you use the opportunity to rain down blows on her.\n\n&lt;img src=data/cage49.png&gt;\n\nYou add to the pain with three solid shots to Kat's head and one of them clearly breaks her nose.

As the orgasm subsides you release Carla and chuckle to yourself as she gasps for air.

A collection of boutique shops and some of the best restaurants and bars in Evindium.\n\nFunny really, as on the other side of the arcade, behind think concrete is an elevator taking raw materials into space.

But the question is whether the whole thing was a set up on you, or he was genuinely scared? This place is covered in cameras, otherwise leaning him over the balcony would get the answer real quick, might get you locked up as well? The thought makes you chuckle, watching the pig dangle over the edge, but certainly not a good idea.\n\nSo what now, you could string along or tell to fuck off. If you string him along, you decide you are going to get your own back, based on what you think. Was it all an act, or was it genuine.

The latter the guards like to watch slowly break down, though they admit they were hoping you were a fighter, but reckon this is a dream come true for you since must you love cock.  With no reaction from you, they push you along by the neck even though you do as you’re told.\n\nYou walk down the corridor and come to a full stop once you walk into what appears to be a briefing room crossed with an arena.

You are taken to a room with a bondage device and are quickly strapped in by your wrists.\n\n&lt;img src=data/kid1.png&gt;\n\nYou are simply told that tonight the guard is going to fuck you and you are going to beg for it. You are to position yourself bent over with your stomach on the table, your legs parted, your hands spreading your pussy lips in invitation. If you don’t, then you will remain in the device for as long as they find entertaining; they warn you they let the last one who did starve and die. The guards leave you there, closing the door behind them as the cold air from the ventilation increases your discomfort by the moment.\n\nYou know their game: a blanket was left in the corner of the room, with the promise that when you comply you can take it back to your cell. Make you pick between pride and comfort, the third step in breaking you down. The first step was imprisonment and the second knowing what punishment exists for those that don’t behave.\n\nThe room is small, likely a maintenance room where engineers can get to pipes.

As you come to, your senses you feel ok, but the power in the suit is failing, the armour feels heavier, and you lose the optical sensors.\n\nYou remove your helmet and the first thing you see is the corpse of the Commander, your sword having fallen to the floor. The problem is the two armour piercing rounds have finished off your chest piece and it needs to come off if you’re going to move. The reason most Evictor Officer’s use armour closets is because it is extremely difficult to remove on your own.\n\nOver the other side of the room you hear a thud as the Evictor Commander crumples to the floor. You try and undue the chest piece and freeze in horror as you head footsteps just outside the door. You deduce the sound of gunfire must have alerted them something was wrong as four Evictor’s come storming in\n\n&quot;Who the fuck is this bitch and what the hell happened to the Commander?!&quot; one of them exclaims. Two Evictor soldiers grab your arms as a third uses a pistol butt to knock you out. \n\n[[Darkness sets in|MRE5B3]]</div><div tiddler="CH4.4" tags="Stat_ 89" created="201611061635" modifier="twee" twine-position="2250,2250">You trudge back to your corner totally naked, you know if you don’t win the next round then the next activity will be your live porn star show.

In his mind he has won, but you are going to change that. As the round starts you fight as you have done previously, this time you feel his cock brush past you during your grappling from time to time. At one stage your hand brushes past it, touching the pre-cum and baby oil coating it. The wrestler is so distracted that he tells you that you should wrestle on the floor, no doubt wanting to fuck you into submission. At the same time he mentions this you fall backwards into one knee and the wrestler goes in like an over eager child, this is your opportunity and you spring out of the way gaining control of his wrist. \n\nYou end up getting the wrestler in an arm bar, his arm being forced upwards by your pussy which you grind into his elbow for satisfaction at all levels. The wrestler tries to hold on and when his arm is close to breaking he taps out, almost having a hissy fit. Clearly someone was being paid for success only. When the referee calls the victory you jump in the air with joy, your tits bouncing and the crowd roar. You idly wonder if once the excitement dies down they will be disappointed that they did not see you lose. Will you?\n\nA dressing gown is handed over and you put it on and walk out of the ring, laughing and pointing- at the wrestler’s now flaccid cock.  A microphone is shoved in your face and you are asked what would you like as a victory reward, you quickly state that you would like to fight the wrestler in the arena again, but with striking allowed. The reply is that this time you would beat him up badly, you smile and say yes. The wrestler looks glum, looks like he is locked into a contract with the promoter.\n\nWith that you head off with the naked promotions girl following you. To your lack of surprise you are offered the promotion girls help in ‘getting cleaned’ up. You say no as you suspect it will be a filmed lesbian show, to annoy them even more you head off to a different shower than what you were offered.

He goes to swing the sword in his left hand but you pull on him forward with your sword, allowing you to easily dodge his attack. This last tug manages to pull your sword out of his gauntlet just as he stumbles, exposing his lightly armored neck. \n\nYou nearly finish the fight with a side swipe that cleaves deep into his neck and collar bone. The damage is further worsened as you pull the blade back in a sawing motion, his blood spraying as he falls with a scream to the floor.. \n\nThe Evictor Commander starts to get up again, but you strike savagely at his helmet while he is on his knees. The attacks don’t manage to penetrate the helmet further open the gaping wound on his neck with each impact. Your next strike sees his armored head sever and bounce across the floor. \n\nAll the adrenalin leaves you in an instant and you feel how drained you are.

The referee then gestures you both to meet in the middle and get ready for the klaxon. As the klaxon goes off you spring toward the wrestler and get a grip, but it is like moving a stone, you just don’t have the bodyweight or strength. The wrestler alternatively finds it hard to get a grip but it is clear he has been practicing as he does not bother with the standard wrestling grips and tries to get you in a bear hug. The first five minutes of the match descends into you trying to stop a man getting you into a bear hug, knocking his arms off and trying not to be pushed into the corner.  Your thoughts keep wandering onto elbow and knee strikes which is your instinctive approach.\n\nThis proves to be your downside as the wrestler gets you into a bear hug and you try to squirm free landing on the floor. The next five minutes is like a mud wrestling match as you both slide across the floor, coating it with baby oil. The wrestler himself is getting covered and your feet and hands, both have their fair share making it harder for you to get a grip and stand. \n\nThe round comes to an end when the wrestler gets behind you and wraps his legs around your hips, his arms circle around your chest pinning your arms to your side. You find yourself sat upright on your backside, pinned and after a short time of struggling the referee calls a pin. The wrestler stays in the same position and watches as the bikini clad girl removes her top and throws it into the crowd. The crowd roars and the wrestler starts to fondle your tits until your nipples go hard and poke through the fabric, with that he slips his hands under the top and stretches it upwards until your tits are exposed to the roaring crowd. He gives your nipples a firm, hard tweak before releasing his hold and using you to help climb to his feet.\n\nAs you climb to your feet you remove your top and fling it into the corner. The wrestler then stands behind you and you feel his erect cock pressing into your back, his trunks straining to keep it in. His hands are on your tits and angrily you remove his hands and stride back into your corner of the ring.

You don’t let this go to your head, sure the show is hoping for a big finish with you only moments from victory. The proximity sensor begins to hum but only strong enough that he’s somewhat close by. You wait a moment to try and feel out his movements but the vibrations stay the same and you cautiously make your way towards the roof entrance as the sensor starts to go crazy.\n\nYou scan the ceiling and hallway for any signs and can’t seem to spot him. Even in this dim light you’re sure you’d be able to make out his blue and black costume so you turn your focus to the door to the roof. With only one possible option left, you kick the door open and stop moving in the middle of your swing when you see nothing.\n \nHis initial plan foiled, the Masked Mamba drops from above the door and swings himself, boots forward, into you, propelling you into the wall.

You immediately regret it as the door is slammed shut and you are confronted by two grinning gang members.\n\n&quot;Ahhh, the running beauty. Not going to run away now, are you?&quot; chuckles the first one. The laughter soon stops as you strike him in the throat and he falls to the floor choking. Before the second one can react you are on him and start slamming his head into the wall. You stop as the woman comes at you with a crow bar. Her heavy swing just misses you and hits the other gang member with a sickening thud. \n\nBefore she can swing again you finish her off with a quick elbow strike which sends her crashing into the wall causing the crow bar hits the floor with a loud clang. Quickly surveying the scene you note that one gang member is probably dead, the one you struck in throat has a fifty-fifty shot since he’s still making choking sounds and the woman is unconscious, probably with a broken jaw.\n\nYou try the door but find it locked with a keypad next to it. None of the gang around you are going to be able to tell you the answer so you decide to hit the stairs and go up, taking the crow bar with you. The crow bar will be no good on security doors like the entrance door but may help you out later. \n\nWhen you reach the third floor you hear a commotion below as the bodies are discovered. You decide to head to the roof as there are a few places where you could make a jump to the next building and escape.\n\n[[Get out of there|Random DT5C]]</div><div tiddler="SC31" tags="" created="201512222306" modifier="twee" twine-position="8130,1130">//Getting beaten in a fight then roughly taken in the ass and used like a piece of meat had Celeste aroused and flustered.

This is followed by an elbow strike and a quick grab for the stun baton when the guard bounces off the wall, rendered completely unconscious. The other guards get to their feet and the first one looks surprised as you zap him.

Almost taking your look as a signal, the man pulls out of your mouth as his friend’s cock pulses in your right hand. You open your mouth as both of them plaster you with rather sizeable loads of cum. The fluids run down your face and into your mouth as you slump to the ground, exhausted.\n\nWhile you catch your breath, one of the men thanks you for showing them a good time. You wipe the cum from your face and it’s so thick you’re briefly enthralled by the idea of licking some of it from your hand but you decide to pass. You aren’t sure if this is really better or worse but it leaves you feeling like a cheap whore. As you are sorting yourself out the men promise you a better night if you come back, more pool and a special treat, for a classy girl like you.

While not helping your predicament, you figure that the stress relief will be good and may help your mind come up with some good ideas. Often your best thinking is when you are relaxed and happy.\n\nYou watch a number of matches and the standards in the dojo appear to be quite low, but the matches are still enjoyable as you mentally try and predict the outcome. Time goes by and you decide it best to leave before you linger for too long. You are amused when one of the other spectators says he’s sure you wish you were as good as the people in the ring. You smile politely, not wanting to be drawn into a conversation, when you want to say that you could take both of them on at the same time.\n\nAs you wander off you dwell on your last thought, thinking of a few different ways you could take them both on as well.\n\n[[Go back to your apartment|Apartment][$Days = $Days + 0.25]]</div><div tiddler="Dojo2C" tags="" created="201512120856" modifier="twee" twine-position="1690,1410">You arranged to meet Lina here for a practice round or two and when you arrive the receptionist tells you that Lina has arrived and is in Court 2 practising.

As you are putting it on you get a touch of the pre-match nerves and the adrenalin starts to course until your in-body systems take over and regulate your nerves. You wonder what is at stake here, your pride, or something else?\n\nOnce you are kitted out you head over to Court Two and announce your presence. Lina finishes off her practice moves then removes her helmet and buzzes you in. You enter holding your helmet and Lina gives you a smile and tells you that she will take it easy on you. You smile back giving nothing away. Lina then asks if you would want to practice traditional Japanese style and you agree. You collect the practice katana that has been delivered and test the weight, perfect. Putting the katana down you don your helmet and within seconds you can see the holographic arena.\n\nYour eyes wander over to Lina in a traditional Japanese silk kimono and hakama with her hair in a bun. The hakama being a long flowing skirt reaching to her ankles. The arena is a wooden circle in a forested mountain valley, very tranquil. The match must be fought inside the circle which physically is slightly smaller than Court 2 and looking at the match settings you note that Lina has gone for real life settings. This means full gore and a sun affect, you are surprised with the former has not all want to see the semi realistic gore affects based on sword strikes.\n\nYou join Lina in a traditional Japanese outfit picking the default settings which look a bit drab when compared to Lina's carefully chosen colours, Lina has clearly spent too long with Giannio.\n\nOnce all is ready you both walk to the marked positions in the ring and give a small bow.\n\n[[The match is on|Dojo2C1]]\n</div><div tiddler="Dojo2A" tags="" created="201512120852" modifier="twee" twine-position="1410,1410">Not wishing to participate in any matches or join in on the competitive circuit you decide to practice your katas.

You remember how they gave you so much excitement, how you were in a feeling of such bliss and contentment.\n\nYou spend ages in the lingerie section, touching, feeling, stroking and then you find the ones you want. You take them reverently to the sale counter, your nipples like rocks, your panties sopping wet inside your jump suit, an orgasm approaching. When you purchase them, there is only one thing……\n\nStrip….. off comes the jump suit and boots\n\nStrip… off comes your panties, thrown over your shoulder\n\nOhhhhhhhh….

You look round grinning at the stunned person at the till, then a few other shoppers, who are gawking.\n\n“Lady, what have you been taking?” comes the voice of the girl behind the till. You vaguely hear other voices, “That bitch is off her head”. \n\nThere is only one thing in your head, that is to call, to call the Master. You don’t know where the number came from, it has just appeared in your head today. It seems ages until the call is answered and you speak\n\n“Master……..” you whisper, the words seeming strange\n\n“…….. Celeste?” the response is slow, doubtful, uncertain even\n\n“Yes, Master” you say, louder, more confident.\n\n“Where are you?” comes a blurted out question.\n\n“In Nicks, in just the stockings Master” you reply, your voice quivering with excitement. \n\n“You want to be fucked Celeste, please your Master and offer your slutty body for their enjoyment” comes a malevolent response.\n\nYes Master” you exclaim, excitement rushing through you.\n\n[[Follow the Master’s Instructions|SG1.1]]\n&lt;&lt;set $Days to $Days + 1&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="MArms2D" tags="" created="201508202056" modifier="twee" twine-position="3790,430">You can tell by the glint in his eye and his eagerness that there is something more behind all of this. Based on your last encounter with Shaun and Carla you ask him whether she knows about this offer. Shaun looks a bit sheepish and tells you that it was Carla who gave him the idea and that she may join them later in the evening. Clearly after breaking his confidence, she is now rebuilding him as her soon to be obedient husband.\n\nYou wonder idly to yourself what the plan is: Carla must have one and Shaun is totally on board. You probe him for more information, but he won’t bite. He only tells you it will be at night. You tell him you won’t give him an answer here and now, but you will seriously consider it... &quot;If I have the time, of course,&quot; you added with a wink. Shaun smiles, trying clearly to cover his disappointment, but asks you to call him if you decide you would like to. He gives you a little kiss on the cheek and you head off on your way.\n\nIf you want to go on a date with Shaun and Carla at some point, then all you need to do is arrange it and turn up at the Ruck's Pool Bar.

He is insistent that you join him for a drink, and with nothing much to lose, you join him a secluded part of the room.\n\nThe conversation quickly moves onto how you met, how you offered advice, and when that fell on deaf ears how you grabbed his balls and took control. Then you told him to strip and taught him how to please a woman with his fingers and tongue. Shaun seems proud of how he finger fucked you to orgasm and how he licked you out to another. \n\nShaun tells you that the next evening he practiced the skills on his girlfriend Carla and made her cream herself. He is really pleased to tell you though how much stronger you are than she is since he could pin her down when she is astride him. You chuckle to yourself as you remember when, while fucking Shaun in the upright position, he grabbed your hips and tried to hold you down so he could cum. You clearly taught him that you were in control. All this talk about sex and the bit of alcohol has had an effect and you feel your nipples prod against your jumpsuit.\n\nAs you are reminiscing, Shaun leans in closer and places a hand on your upper thigh and asks you whether you want to go back to his place again. You consider it. To be fair, going back to Shaun’s is really about Shaun cheating on his girlfriend... You have already shown him the basics and it is up to him to improve his sex life. A good fucking is never a bad thing though. You could spice up his life a bit more and offer to meet Carla, the kinky girlfriend. Maybe it's best to just call it quits as both these options, though enjoyable, are distractions nonetheless. \n \n[[Go back to Shaun’s place|MArms2B]]\n[[Suggest you finally meet Carla|MArms2C]]\n[[Pass and head back to your apartment|Apartment][$Days = $Days + 0.25]]\n&lt;&lt;elseif visited(&quot;MArms1D&quot;)&gt;&gt;You stay for a drink or two and meet Shaun.

He insists that you helped open his mind up to what is going wrong and that he wants to thank you.\n\nShaun wants to treat you for a night out starting at the Ruck's Pool Bar on the condition you come dressed up for a night out.

I'll also send you a list of people who might have jobs for you but unfortunately I don't have many dealings with these people so I can’t vouch for them personally. I wish you the best of luck, Celeste,&quot; he says and then gets to his feet. You rise as well and Mr. Grayson extends his hand.

You tell Shaun that if she is truly as kinky as he says, then she will be up for it. Five minutes later, Shaun returns and says that Carla said to come over to her apartment. She is looking forwards to meeting you and he confides that he sent a photo of you over to Carla at her request. You ask Shaun what she said when she saw the photo and he smiles and tells you that you’ll see soon enough. \n\nShaun books a taxi for the short journey over to Carla's apartment. During the taxi ride, he is really excited and puts his hand on your leg a few times and brushes your breasts with his elbow. All 'accidental' touches but he is bursting with excitement as the bulge in his pants blatantly indicates. Carla's apartment is in a modest area of downtown and is quite pleasant; far nicer than your rented apartment, for sure. As Shaun rings the entry buzzer you are buzzed up.\n\nWhile taking the lift, Shaun gropes your butt and tells you you’re going to have a great time. You smile and wonder to yourself whether he has creamed his pants yet. You approach the apartment door and Carla answers it completely naked. This is slightly undermined when she gives you a shy smile and ushers you both inside. \n\nCarla is an attractive woman in her twenties with blonde hair. She is clearly quite the catch for someone like Shaun. Shaun looks flabbergasted and you ignore him to focus on Carla's pert ass swaying as she walks toward the bedroom. Playing Shaun at his own game, you squeeze his butt and push him towards the bedroom and echo his earlier sentiment that’s it’s going to be a great time. As you walk into the bedroom, Carla is already lying down on the queen sized bed on her belly, her eyes resting on you.\n\n&quot;So you are going to help Shaun become a stud I hear,&quot; she says with a bemused tone. You smile back, nod, and start stripping your clothes off. Shaun can’t quite believe his luck, hopping while trying to pull his trousers past his erection. Carla pats the bed next to her and says, &quot;Come here. Not yet for you, Shaun. You can watch.&quot;\n\nShaun does what he is told and you take up Carla's offer and crawl onto the bed, naked, leaving your clothes behind you in a pile. She climbs up and off her belly to a kneeling position, and when you are close, pulls your arms so you both end up kneeling and facing each other. She then embraces you and kisses you passionately. \n\nCarla breaks the kiss, nibbles your ear, and then whispers, &quot;I work as a dominatrix in the Red Light District. Shaun will make a good husband for me, but only if he does what he is told.&quot; As you are digesting this, Carla explores your back with her hands. &quot;Shaun does not know,&quot; she finishes before she breaks from your ear and looks into your eyes. \n\n&quot;//This could be an interesting night!//&quot; you think to yourself. You’re committed to helping Shaun please his girlfriend and Carla is certainly going to call the shots!\n\n[[Let Carla guide the evening|MArms2C1]]</div><div tiddler="MArms2B" tags="" created="201508201019" modifier="twee" twine-position="2530,430">Thinking only of yourself and your sexual needs, you tell Shaun that you would like to go back to his place again. He smiles and rests his hand on your upper thigh, moves up your leg, then rubs your covered pubic mound, sending a shiver through you. He then moves up your body onto your right breast, gently stroking it, before moving up to your cheek. Shaun turns your head towards him and kisses you on the lips. \n\n&quot;Thank you,&quot; Shaun says, &quot;You will not regret it.&quot;\n\nYou smile back, amused that Shaun has made such a public gesture. He then grabs your hand and stands up. You pull your hand away from him and then smack him on his backside.\n\n&quot;Remember who the teacher is, Shaun,&quot; you curtly remind him. Your thoughts wander onto the same old problem; fuck a man once and they act like they suddenly own you.\n\nDuring the journey back to Shaun’s his mobile phone rings and he gulps as he answers. You can only assume it is Carla by his expression, whispered comments, and the final remark of, &quot;I will see you tomorrow darling.&quot; Clearly he is playing a dangerous game. You decide that you will have your fun but he will be taught another lesson tonight via bondage.\n\nYou get back to Shaun's and quickly strip down to your underwear. Once you’ve stripped, you see Shaun sitting on the bed, naked but for his socks, which are getting rapidly pulled off. \n\n&quot;Shaun,&quot; you purr, digging a nailed fingers into his chest hair, &quot;For the next lesson, I’m tying you up, to stop you from using your arms.&quot;\n\nShaun looks excited and says, &quot;Yes, teacher. Carla left these restraints here.&quot; He points towards a chest of drawers by the bedside. You quickly pull out the restraints and expertly tie his wrists to the bedposts, leaving his legs free. \n\nYou look at Shaun laid on his back, penis pointing upwards, his arms tied to the bedposts. You wonder whether you should ride him and leave him like this or just masturbate and then leave. You could even message Carla to have her come over and find him like this. Your thought process is disrupted by the strong feeling that someone else is in the apartment. Not giving Shaun any cause for alarm, you leave the bedroom in your underwear and discreetly pick up a makeshift weapon. Looking back, you put your finger to your lips, signaling for him to stay quiet.\n\n[[Someone else is in his apartment|MArms2B1]]</div><div tiddler="Work at Shebo5" tags="" created="201504081454" modifier="twee" twine-position="1130,1690">&lt;&lt;if $SheboNextVisit &lt; $Days&gt;&gt;Your fifth shift at Shebo's.

Apart from getting the Magnum hidden every interaction with the smugglers has been an opportunity for sex or lewd behaviour.  Are you treating the Smugglers Bar as a place to let go? A safe place? These guys and a few girls are criminals after all, and what do they think of you? Well you saved the lives of a few of them, including Tyrone but after that? Your recent behaviour has been interesting……..\n\n&lt;&lt;if $SmugglerTart is 2.25&gt;&gt;You fucked Tyrone on the mission, but managed to hold it together while doing the pole dance. If holding it together means stripping naked, dancing lewdly.&lt;&lt;elseif $SmugglerTart is 2.5&gt;&gt;You fucked Tyrone on the mission and then stripped naked in the smugglers bar and finished it off by masturbating in the toilets.  You might have got away with it, if you were not so loud!&lt;&lt;elseif $SmugglerTart is 2.75&gt;&gt;You fucked Tyrone on the mission, and then offered free BJ's to the whole crew. Real classy stuff, you can't even remember if you done Tyrone at the same time?&lt;&lt;elseif $SmugglerTart is 3&gt;&gt;You are treading a dangerous line, fucking Tyrone on the mission, stripping naked, followed by a pole dance and then another public fucking from Tyrone. Really classy stuff. &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; So what are they going to expect today and what are going to do? You are going to need to have a chat with Tyrone that is for sure. But do you say you got carried away, or just carry on?\n\nAs it is, Tyrone is around and wants to speak to you, when you see him he looks a little preoccupied and ushers you into his back office;\n\n&quot;I want to be straight with you Celeste, I’ve had word that certain people are looking for you and your ship, there is a reward out for a lead resulting in capture&quot;, he tells you not adding in any detail of his intentions.\n\nYou look at him weighing up your options, now if he was going to sale you out, he would have done it. So he is either after extra money or fishing for how long you were going to be staying for, or he is going to withdraw his ship hiding service. After thinking about it you reply;\n\n&quot;If I’m caught, they will work out who hid me and kill you, if you rat on me, they will probably kill you to ensure no witnesses, I need all my money to get off planet at the moment, but I might come to some extra arrangement as a good will gesture at the end&quot; you tell him, generally sincere about the extra money.\n\nTyrone considers what you said and then replies, “I came to the same conclusion, I’m stuck, maybe I shouldn’t have offered you hiding, but I’ve done it now, I thought about killing you and Jane, but I don’t know if you have any more operatives on planet, nor how your supporters would react. So I’m stuck”.\n\n&quot;I’m sorry you tell him, it is a stressful situation but my wider team is working hard to get us off planet&quot; you tell him, keeping the details of your wider team vague. Just in case he does get any solid ideas about killing you both! You end with a helpful line, not expecting an answer, “Can I do anything to make things better, all things considered?”\n\nWhen you see the look in his eyes, your mind wishes you hadn’t, your body tingles in anticipation.\n\n&quot;I want a threesome with you and Jane&quot;, Tyrone tells you, licking his lips, &quot;A night I’ll remember&quot; he finishes off, looking you in the eye.\n\nYou think it through and know that you could make Jane go along with it, you would just need to pick a safe place in case he was thinking of knocking you both off! Were you being fucked up, or just distrustful, but it is how you would eliminate the pair of you.\n\n[[Agree|SH3.1]]\n[[Offer yourself, here and now|SH3.2]]\n</div><div tiddler="Work at Shebo1" tags="" created="201504072133" modifier="twee" twine-position="570,1690">Your first shift at the Shebo's passes in a whirl of activity. A night of waitressing, introductions, a photo shoot, and getting fitted for a new outfit which they chose for you. This is now your 'Shebo Uniform' as all the hostesses have their own distinctive outfit.\n\nApart from gaining money at Shebo's, the key thing for you is to make social engagements, with three corporations standing out as the most desirable: [[Perco Corporation]], [[Xena Corporation]], and [[Lantis Corporation]].\n\nThey are all interested in getting you to be part of their hostess team and favoring one for short time has its advantages. For one, you will get more from your current favourite and the other two may try harder to win you back, especially if they think you are uncertain. You have to be careful to make sure you don't to favour one too much, as you will end up part of their hostess team.\n\nThinking of gaining favoritism, your mind drifts back to the photo shoot you participated in earlier that day. A new hostess uses her first photo set to demonstrate who she wants to be and to showcase her personality.\n\n[[You took a more languid approach to your shoot|Shebo1A]]\n[[You took a more provocative approach to your shoot|Shebo1B]]</div><div tiddler="Shebo5D" tags="Stat_92" created="201711162007" modifier="twee" twine-position="5470,1690">With the shoot over the table is tilted back, the dildos and ball gag are removed, then the restraints. You lie there for 30 long seconds then swing your legs over and get up, get your costume and let the make-up girl sort you out. Such is the life of a hostess, the ability to get back to work, like nothing has happened is a key skill. \n\nYou are very aware of where you were, you can feel the bruises on your ankles and wrists, and the heat in your loins from being stuffed with two big dildos. But now, the chance to go from table to table and annoy the other hostesses by making them second best.  You don’t know why, but the thought of being the toughest, most slutty and hardcore hostess just makes you feel good. \n\nThe shift proves useful, maybe. Well for a start you get loads of offers, well prostitution offers and for most of them, you may consider it. Fucking your way through this lot will bring you in a few hundred credits at least, but it is the time. Maybe one a week, you can’t sell yourself out twice a day, these are busy men and women, who don’t have much space in their calendars.  You wonder to yourself that the trials of Shebo and the planet in general make the thought of high class prostitution seem quite a good idea, especially when your recent celebrity is tripling the //standard// high class rate. You just need the credits to get off planet, it is not as if you are going to take up escorting in your time between missions when you get off planet. The thought stays in your head, battling things out….. //So the sex is not good, the man only cares about his own pleasure// over //you like it rough, to be mistreated and used, it is good, and you get paid for it, not great money but better than doing it for free?// ‘’Right?’’\n\nAside from your warring thoughts, there is one interesting thing. You have been approached by the Xena Exec’s for two things; firstly, they are really excited about their CEO visiting the planet, and that they want to show you off, and for you to offer your full services, of which you will be amply rewarded. Secondly, they have created a device, and they think you would be a great person to test it out, they think and more worryingly hope it is worse than anything in the trials.  When you look slightly alarmed they tell you that you will only be in for a few hours, they want your opinion as they have designed it for a //special// person. \n\nYou have no real choice but to agree it, though you always not return to Shebo and leave them in the lurch! Not that you care, it would just amuse you.  Curiosity does get to you though, eavesdropping on the conversation you understand that the Xena CEO has never been to the planet, and was never expected to. Apparently, something happened around $Days ago and the big, big boss is coming to the planet.  So, knowing you had something to do with why he is coming do you enter the lion’s den, or chicken out.  After all, how far do you want to stretch your luck?\n\nThe CEO is expected in 5-10 days, plenty of time to make a choice. As you finish your shift, you count a decent amount in tips. \n\n[[Return to your apartment|Apartment]]\n&lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;WARNING: &lt;&lt;popup &quot;Your Mental Status has changed!&quot; &quot;SC92&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Mental = $Mental + 1&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Shebo to 6&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $SheboNextVisit to $Days + 5&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Days = $Days + 1&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Credits = $Credits + 20&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;\n</div><div tiddler="Work at Shebo3" tags="" created="201504081454" modifier="twee" twine-position="850,1690">&lt;&lt;if $SheboNextVisit &lt; $Days&gt;&gt;You arrive for your third shift at Shebo's.

You would have to be subtle in order to do this, otherwise the show’s producers would catch you right away. If you did manage to pull it off, then they wouldn't know how you did it before your pay day comes. They might come back for retribution later on but they’ll have to join the long list of people already looking for you!\n\nThe first thing you need to do is to get some inside knowledge. Jane is fairly certain that if you gained access to an employee’s data tab or a work terminal, you would be able to access and download any information they had about upcoming show. You tell her you think you know just the person and give James a call to see if he would like to meet up for an evening of drinks and maybe some fun. He gladly accepts your invitation and you agree to see him at Red’s Space Bar later that evening.\n\n[[Head out to meet with James|Intel3.2]]</div><div tiddler="SH7.5B" tags="" created="201804162135" modifier="twee" twine-position="1830,3090">Jane straddles Tyrone, and rides him slowly, you sit on the side-lines watching.  This does not last long before Tyrone calls you; &quot;Hey Celeste, I want to see you making out with Jane&quot; he tells you, slightly demanding.\n\n&quot;Maybe, I will if you lick me out&quot; you banter, thinking Tyrone will refuse. However, Tyrone calls your bluff, and thinking he will chicken out, you straddle his face, then quickly find him eating you out. Now slightly unnerved you face Jane. Jane looks invitingly at you, a sly //I dare you// smile across her face. You put your arms around and lean in, slightly unsure. Jane stops bouncing on Tyrone’s cock, and gently rolls her hips taking Tyrone deep within herself. \n\n&lt;img src=data/ss18.png&gt;\n&lt;img src=data/ss19.png&gt;\n\nJane leans in for the kiss, and with a moments hesitation you kiss back, tongues entwining. \n\n&lt;img src=data/ss20.png&gt;\n\nJane breaks off the kiss, and a big smile appears on her face, and like a battle won, starts fucking Tyrone with more energy.  You grind your pussy into his face, demanding more attention.\n\nTyrone breaks off the pussy licking with a groan, and you pull yourself off him and watch, looking to see if you suffocated him at all!  You glance over at the time, and see you are running out of time, you both agreed that you wanted to move Jane in darkness and quiet hours.  It is time to agree the final thrill for Tyrone, you wait and watch Jane's tits bouncing hard as Tyrone puts all his effort into his second orgasm for the night, it doesn't take long until he spurts into Jane.\n\nNow for the final event, Tyrone wants a joint cocksucking session, you have a different idea.\n\n[[Joint cocksucking|SH7.6A]]\n[[Jointly blow his mind|SH7.6B]]\n</div><div tiddler="Intel3.3" tags="" created="201606011410" modifier="twee" twine-position="4490,3090">The information that James has unwittingly provided you will only get you so far. Running the Gauntlet is a show and it is carefully controlled on multiple levels for the audience enjoyment. As he thrusts into you rapidly from behind, you finally come up with a plan as your own orgasm approaches. You just know that your best option is going to be getting in with someone on the executive management level once they arrive on planet. Your plan finally formulated, you feel your body celebrate as your pussy clenches around James’s cock, ensuring another load of his cum quickly follows suit.\n\nAfter a second, more vigorous fucking, he is completely worn out and enquires about your stamina and sex drive. You tell him you are addicted to sex and have a side-line as a high-end escort. James looks flabbergasted at the revelation and nervously asks if that means he is a customer. You smile politely and say you are not interested in his money and that you enjoyed really did enjoy his company. However, if he happened to know any of the show’s executives who would be interested, you could arrange a night to remember for them. You assure him that you have access to some of the hottest sex clubs on planet and could make it well worth their time.\n\nJames asks to hear a little more about what you do and you explain that escorting is your specialism: taking men around the best clubs, letting the tension build, then going for a marathon sex session whenever and wherever they want. James is shocked, intrigued, and turned on; his face his priceless. You take his cock in your mouth and he sighs with pleasure and tells you that he will get you the contact details of one of the senior show managers. He reckons he will be in the boss’s good books when they visit this backwater planet if he’s able to present them with someone as exciting as you’ve been.\n\nYour new plan successfully in motion, you suck James off until he lets out a feeble spurt of cum that barely coats your tongue, then you gulp it down. This makes three loads inside of you from him tonight, including the two lots oozing down your leg. You and him both shower and shortly after you leave James and head back to your apartment. You bask in the afterglow of an orgasm, a successful rendezvous, and a clever escorting side-line.\n\n[[Return to your apartment|Apartment]] &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Int3 to &quot;Complete&quot;&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Int19 to &quot;True&quot;&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $Days = $Days + 2&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $rgex to $Days + 4&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;endnobr&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Intel3.2" tags="" created="201604292208" modifier="twee" twine-position="4350,3090">After an evening spent in James’s company sharing drinks, your infiltration equipment extracts the contents of his data tab and it proves extremely fruitful. James is good company and considerate on your date, so when he asks if you’d like to come back to his place for a bit, you gladly accept.\n\nWhen you arrive at his apartment, you trade kisses as he leads you straight to his bedroom. He lays you on the edge of the bed, hikes the skirt of your dress up, then to your surprise, drops to his knees and begins going down on you. As his tongue flicks back and forth across your lower lips, Jane calls in over your comm chip. You wrap your thighs around his head, locking him in place, but more importantly covering his ears so that you can pick up. \n\n&quot;Go ahead, Jane,&quot; you whisper. &quot;I’m a bit occupied at the moment though, so this will be a one-way conversation.&quot;\n\nYou release James’s head and he takes a deep breath of air as soon as he is free. He stands with a grin, encouraged by your feistiness it seems, and strips of his pants and briefs to reveal a modest, but hard, erection. Just as the head of his cock slides between your folds, Jane begins to explain the decryption has revealed the course layouts that he has planned, but not much else. \n\nShe finishes up going over the course layouts and some of the terrain issues you might encounter when James warns you he is about to cum. You smile and tighten your pelvic muscles and tell him to go ahead as you push your hips towards his. A few short thrusts later, James pants and digs his hands into your hips as his seed spills inside of you.\n\nJames pulls out to catch his breath, and as much as you’re enjoying the pleasure part of this, you start trying to think of a way he could be of further use for you.\n\n&quot;//I can always mix business and pleasure and come up with a plan while he fucks me again//,&quot; you think with a chuckle. &quot;//Plus men are much more pliable when pleasured. Maybe I’ll even get to cum this time around//&quot;\n\nYou roll over and position yourself on your knees over the edge of the bed, his cum running down your inner leg, as your flushed pussy invited him back in for another round.\n\n[[Now to come up with a plan|Intel3.3]]</div><div tiddler="GAME GOALS" tags="" created="201504052124" modifier="twee" twine-position="3790,10">&lt;h3&gt;GAME GOALS&lt;/h3&gt;The main goal of the game is to reach one of the games multiple endings, preferably a good one for Celeste and her friends. To ideal ending would result in Jane and Celeste getting off the planet, with or without the ship, and Celeste must remain in control of her destiny. Along the way, changes will occur to Celeste's personality which can be tracked with the two [[status]] gauges ''Submissiveness'' and Sid's ''Training''. \n\nThe 'Submissiveness' gauge is the measure of control you have over yourself and to refuse those with some form of authority over you. If you reach 100 in this category, you will have little control over your actions when influenced by others. You will likely encounter a game over if you happen to encounter someone who wouldn’t look out for a mindlessly obedient Celeste. The 'Training' gauge will affect dialogue and the choices made available to you throughout the game. Changes to both these scores are unavoidable in order to achieve success in the various missions and encounters.\n\nOther bad endings can be achieved through the choices made during the game and due to the ever ticking-clock until they are discovered on planet. The more days you spend on the planet the more likely that the wrong people are going to catch up with and find you.\n\nThe apartment Sid provides you with is your hub. From there you can attend missions, act on intelligence, and explore Evindium. Missions are the core way to progress through the game’s core story. Acting on intelligence will provide you with new missions and your encounters while you explore will gain you this precious Intel. Regardless of what you choose to do, keep in mind that all actions suck up time and eventually someone will come knocking...\n\nIn order to have success, Celeste is going to need to make allies during her time on Evindium.

She pinches your nose between her left toes then begins to grind her right heel into your throbbing clit. You go moan out her left foot presses down and keeps you from opening your mouth. Carla increases the pressure on your clit causing a sharp pain to shoot through your entire body but you can't help but grind harder against it, desperately trying to cum.\n\n&quot;Do you need me to stop, dear?&quot; she checks when she notices the pain on your face and you vehemently shake your head no. &quot;Good slave. Relish in the pain of your punishment and cum in submission to my perfect feet!&quot;\n\nYou arch your back and shake violently in orgasmic bliss for half-a-minute as she keeps you pinned down with her feet. As the ripples of your orgasm subsides, you relax and your breathing starts to return to normal ranges.\n\nOnce you've recovered, Carla helps you up and jokes you may be becoming a masochist before helping you back into your clothes.

If you get close to cumming, let me know. I promise you there won't be any funny business this time,&quot; she says with an innocent snicker.\n\nHer left foot alternates kneading sensually over your breasts as her right foot softly circles your clit and occasionally dips along your lips once you part your legs for her.

Right, Celeste?&quot; \n\n&quot;Maybe I do, but I am still outclassed in speed, strength and firepower. I would die in a shootout or in hand to hand combat unless surprise was on my side,&quot; you admit grimly.\n\nMaddock accepts this but reminds me what he is capable of doing wonderful things with mechs. The mission conversation ends with you promising to review the data Maddock has.\n\nYou spend some time talking to Maddock about what he does and he does not strike you as a normal 'freedom fighter'. There seems to be a lot of focus on Xena Corporation and there is more to this than meets the eye. Even for a freedom fighter, his operation seems awfully cheap in set up.\n\nEventually the conversation draws to an end and Maddock indicates it is time to go. Before he finishes Maddock introduces Claire as his operational lead and the person you will be working with. Claire promises you she will explain her role during the journey back, however you are still not trusted enough to be able to see out of the van. \n\nThe conversation with Claire is conducted through a microphone and speaker in the back of the van. When Claire drops you off in Downtown you have a few minutes of face-to-face time before you take the public transport back to your apartment.\n\nClaire is a shrewd operator and you are sure that she has a past as an investigator for a corporation or government outfit of some sort.

What do you want from me?&quot; \n\nThinking quickly you reply &quot;Ok, when I say a botched mission, I really mean I need some evidence altered before it comes to bite me on the ass.

Maddock laughs.\n\n&quot;Celeste, that is beyond my abilities unless it was an inside job. Physical access to the core or gaining some access codes would make it possible. I've done it before but it cost my contact his life.&quot; Maddock looks down clearly pained by losing people from his cause.\n\n&quot;If I get those things sorted would you do it?&quot; you ask.\n\n&quot;Yes, I would. However, I don't fully trust you. You will need to do something for me first.&quot;\n\nYou are expecting this and wait patiently for Maddock to continue. &quot;Ever since the death of the corporate executive, Xena Corporation has been using the Evictor Mercenaries for bloody retribution. I want you to kill their leader and hack their computer system, exposing their atrocities to the world.&quot;\n\nMaddock clearly wants to show that the corporations are not untouchable.

I don't want to work directly for anyone.&quot; \n\nMaddock smirks, just a small flicker at the edge of his lips, then his face returns to a deadpan look.\n\n&quot;I appreciate the honesty... even if you’re just a corporate pawn,&quot; he retorts. \n\nYou laugh. &quot;Give me other options and I might consider. I would rather be part of the system than fight against it.&quot; \n\nMaddock considers this and the conversation moves onto label; you as a mercenary and Maddock as 'Freedom Fighter' or 'Terrorist'. You briefly discuss the rights and wrongs of each.\n\nFollowing this, the conversation moves onto how this can be mutually beneficial for you both. You talk about a desire to hack the planetary security force system and are encouraged when Maddock does not say you are mad, just that he’s &quot;done that crap before&quot;. When your expression shows your eagerness Maddock adds the detail that it’s not actually that easy as he’ll need direct access to the planetary core or the access codes.

His speech takes you back to the time when you joined the marines, just a young girl looking to work for the good guys.

You are unceremoniously dropped on the floor and the man who was fucking you at the time is blown away in a hail of bullets. You quickly roll onto your belly, acutely aware that you are sliding around on a mixture of bodily fluids.

You worry that the Evictors may be able to give pursuit but Claire assures you that they expect to be long gone by then. A towel is thrown your way along with some basic clothing. It will do for the moment as you need more than a shower to get rid of this mess.\n\n&quot;Not that I’m complaining, but how exactly did you find me?&quot; you ask Claire as you dress.\n\nClaire gives you a sad, knowing smile and beings to explain, &quot;We had another agent in there who told us what there were no guards and all Evictors were recalled,. We were worried something had gone wrong and when we found out them all in the hall waiting to fuck you, we immediately began killing the bastards.

With his cock inside of you, he grabs your hips and starts to slowly fuck you. His slow place quickly increases as he begins to thrust in and out of you.

The smugglers are working at a container and appear to have not posted any armed guards or lookouts. There are no visible weapons but you are pretty sure that some have side arms of some nature. The mech would be overkill in this situation. Heck, even the mercenaries would be more than is necessary.\n\nYou give the greenlight as the ground floor door locks are overridden. With a loud metallic clang and stomp, the mech storms in as the power is cut to the terminal. All containers tracks come to a rest in their current position. The only noise is the mech banging before you hear the ominous robotic voice call out, &quot;Hostiles Detected.&quot;\n\n&lt;img src=data/termf3.png&gt;\n\n[[It is going to be a bloodbath|Smuggler 1B]]</div><div tiddler="Smuggler 1B" tags="" created="201511212220" modifier="twee" twine-position="1270,4210">&lt;img src=data/termf4.png&gt;\n\nYou watch the smugglers as most run for cover. One foolish soul puts his hands up in an attempt to surrender. One of the mercs shoots at him first and misses but the mech finishes the job with a stream of gunfire that leaves the smuggler a pile of red gooey mush. With the mech’s initial scan complete, the code you added kicks in and its targeting software goes haywire as it turns on on the mercenary unit as high risk targets. \n\nThings go downhill fast for the mercenaries since they are unprepared for combat with a mech. The machine annihilating them with robotic precision. Your previous experience allows you to keep a low profile and remain undetected by its sensors. The survivors of the mercenary group quickly flee as the mech gives chase and the communication channel goes nuts. The power comes back on in the building which allows security to use the reinforced loading doors to hopefully trap the mech.\n\nLooking over the carnage you notice Billy among the dead. You return your attention to the smugglers and you see them still crouched in cover. They have spotted you and know they are stuck out in the open. Time is limited and you need to engage them before they flee.\n\n&quot;Hey, I’m on your side!&quot; your voice booms through amplified speakers attached to your armour. &quot;The mech was re-programmed by me. I’m going to come down so I can speak with you!&quot;\n\nNone of the smugglers move as you descend and you note a lot of chatter amongst them. They don't have much choice but no-one wants to be the first to address you. When you’re lowered down to their level on smuggler finally removes himself from cover and takes a step towards you. \n\n&lt;img src=data/termf5.png&gt;\n\n&quot;I'll talk, but we don't have much time,&quot; he says with a sense of urgency about him. &quot;If you are really on our side, we need to escape since that mech could come back at any moment&quot;\n\n&quot;Lead on, I will follow you from behind,&quot; you respond as you walk towards him. &quot;You need to learn to trust me. I was told to tell you that 'Maddock sent me' and you would know what that means.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah, we know Maddock,&quot; the smuggler responds, his body visibly relaxing. &quot;Follow me.&quot;\n\n[[Follow the smuggler|Smuggler 2]]</div><div tiddler="Intel 5 Start" tags="" created="201504252245" modifier="twee" twine-position="4070,3370">You use the details supplied Mr. Grayson and make contact with Maddock.

You agree and you are driven around the city, clearly in an attempt to disorientate you. After a few hours the vehicle stops and you are allowed out. You find yourself inside an abandoned warehouse or industrial complex.\n\nYou are led down to a basement room where you meet a few armed bodyguards and a man who Claire states to be Maddock himself. Upon seeing you, Maddock stands and nods but does not offer his hand. You are surprised as you were expecting a 'cyber geek' but instead Maddock is an imposing black man who is clearly a shrewd operator. Maddock waves you over to a nearby stool and you take a seat. Claire hovers a few steps behind and you’re unsure if she is just an interested party or a bodyguard.\n\n&quot;So Maddock, I hear you have some work for me?&quot; you open.

Your wealth is trivial compared to society’s elite. Maddock again holds his gaze with you in silence before getting to the question you've been dreading most. \n\n&quot;What I don't get is why a high flying mercenary is down here on my little world.

Hell, you have just been a bit of an exhibitionist, but you took up their dare and why should you be shy when getting changed, you are a soldier after all.&lt;&lt;elseif $SmugglerTart is 1.5&gt;&gt;You stripped in front of them on the mission and then stripped to your underwear again for the pole dance. Just fun right? You have totally crossed the line though, no wonder Tyrone wants to fuck you real bad, and thinks you will be up for it.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n\n“Look Tyrone, I really like you, but look I’m pretty stressed with the situation I’m in, and I need to focus, and I have a tonne of things to sort out. I promise that when everything is sorted I, and maybe and Jane will come out with you, and who knows what will happen?” you tell him, winking at the end.\n\n“Ok, I had to try it, and maybe I thought you were coming around here more than you needed, I thought, well I thought there was something building between us, I’ll be straight with you, I’m not going to sell you out, but please be careful, and get everything sorted” Tyrone replies, looking slightly disappointed.\n\nYou speak for a short while, and then head off.\n\n[[Return to apartment|Apartment]]&lt;&lt;set $SH to 5&gt;&gt;\n</div><div tiddler="RTG4A4" tags="" created="201609020406" modifier="twee" twine-position="710,5470">You feel your arms start to give and you start to worry your stamina is going to run out before his. The previous events have left you even more tired than usual and he practically came into this in top form. As you start to lose your footing and have to step backward, you notice that your back has to be towards the button and Mark is actually pushing you towards it. Your arms begin to give and he clearly begins to become more confident.\n\n&quot;I can’t believe I had to take my mask off for the first time because of some dumb whore like you. I have to know, before you die,&quot; he leads as he forces you back a few more steps but you manage to keep your balance. &quot;How in the hell did you know I was waiting for you when I first got the drop on you?&quot;\n\nYou smile and are forced back as you watch the rage on his face continue to increase. Now only a few feet from the pillar with the button, you know he’d grab you to quickly if you made a break for it, but you can almost reach it.\n\n&quot;You really want to know?&quot; you antagonize him and muster a small, weak chuckle. &quot;You were like a cello beneath my fingertips... I played you perfectly when I stuck a proximity sensor in your ass the first time I drew your blood!&quot;\n\n&quot;’’You fucking bitch!’’&quot; Mark screams as he releases his grip then swings at your face with a lightning fast right hook. \n\nMark unleashes a series of consecutive blows into your face and core, pushing you back until you can barely stand and blood runs down your face. Dazed, you begin to double over when he grabs you by the throat and forces you against the pillar having nearly gone berserk.\n\n&quot;Any last words for the camera before you lose, you cunt?!&quot; he screams as he draws his other arm back to smash your face in.\n\n&quot;Yeah...&quot; you manage in a low whisper as you look down into his eyes as the rain runs down over both of you. Both of the camera drones hover in close, careful to catch your final breaths in graphic detail. &quot;You lose, dumbass...&quot;\n\n[[Smash the button just beside your left arm|RTG4A5]]</div><div tiddler="MArms3" tags="" created="201505092149" modifier="twee" twine-position="850,430">The Miners Arms seems a little empty at the moment; it must be time for a shift change. You decide it isn’t worth it to hang around here any longer.\n\n[[Return to Downtown|Apartment]]</div><div tiddler="RTG4A2" tags="" created="201609020153" modifier="twee" twine-position="430,5470">You look over the weapons and choose a four-foot metal pole over any of the bladed items available. The reinforced lining of the Masked Mamba’s suit would already protect from slicing weapons and his new arm plates would shatter most blades. You’re confident that if you can get a good strike in against his skull through his mask that it won’t do so well against the blunt force trauma. So long as Mark didn’t go blabbing about his encounter with you to Charles you shouldn’t have too much to worry about.\n\nYou take no chances while making use of all your infiltration expertise to make your way up to the sixth floor. You don’t let this go to your head, sure the show is hoping for a big finish with you only moments from victory. The proximity sensor begins to hum but only strong enough that he’s somewhat close by. You wait a moment to try and feel out his movements but the vibrations stay the same and you cautiously make your way towards the roof entrance as the sensor starts to go crazy.\n\nYou scan the ceiling and hallway for any signs and can’t seem to spot him. Even in this dim light you’re sure you’d be able to make out his blue and black costume so you turn your focus to the door to the roof. With only one possible option left, you kick the door open and go to swing, only to find nothing as you stop yourself from rushing through. \n\nHis initial plan foiled, the Masked Mamba drops from above the door and swings himself, boots forward, into you, propelling you into the wall. With only the proximity sensor to thank for still having your wits about you, you are able to brace yourself and come rushing back, struggling to force him out onto the roof. As you stumble outside, you spot the button across the roof that can put a stop to all of this and try and figure out a plan of attack.\n\n[[Time to throw down|RTG4A3]]</div><div tiddler="RTG4A3" tags="" created="201609020218" modifier="twee" twine-position="570,5470">Mark wastes no time going on the attack and draws his sword and comes at you with a rapid barrage of slices you barely manage to avoid. You search for an opening in his attacks to get a good swipe at his skull with your metal pole but can’t seem to find a single opening as he refuses to let up. Even as he is focused on cutting you down, he is equally careful to make sure you can’t get around him to make a break for the button.\n\nYou find yourself losing ground while on the defensive and slowly get pushed back towards the wall. Quickly running out of room, you come up with a desperate bid to at least even the playing field and suddenly drop your body before swinging up towards his head. As anticipated, his blade slices through your pole, leaving one end pointed as the other goes flying. You try to twist your body to avoid losing your arm so the blade will pass under it as you strike back. Your plan goes somewhat awry as the tip of his blade manages to catch above your left breast as you dodge the rest of the swipe and bring the side of your pipe up into his chin.\n\nStill not registering the blood flowing from the shallow cut on your chest, you take advantage of the short window your blow has brought as thunder cracks above you and it starts to pour rain. You knock his sword to the ground and toss your pipe as you reach for one of his pistols as you spin past him. By the time you come to your stance and orient your shot at his face, you find yourself also staring down a barrel as your arms come parallel to one another. Mark’s face is already starting to swell and blood is covering his lower face; you can’t decide if it’s from his mouth or chin. You both stay frozen, neither making the slightest move or sound until Mark’s eyes wide.\n\n&quot;Yuh... You! I finally recognize your face,&quot; he says with a mix of pain, amusement, and frustration painted across his eyes underneath his mask, both of you still waiting to end the other in an instant. &quot;No wonder Charles asked me to make sure you had such a fantastical dea-.&quot; \n\nMark is cut off as he finally chokes and begins to choke on his blood underneath his mask. You try to make your move and squeeze the trigger as you dodge to the side. Somehow he still has the finesse to dodge your shot while ripping off his mask and counter attacking. He attempts to whip you with his pistol, before you both end up having your weapons knocked to the ground before you. His face twitches in rage as blood runs down his chin and he screams before lunging at you and you end up in a grapple for your life.\n\n[[His stamina seems insurmountable|RTG4A4]]</div><div tiddler="RTG4A1" tags="" created="201609020153" modifier="twee" twine-position="290,5470">The other contestant timidly steps through the entrance to the hotel and as soon as they are a few feet clear it shuts and makes an automated locking noise. The TV screens flicker back on and start displaying the feed of two different camera drones, one of which is following the contestant while the other appears to be randomly floating around the building’s halls. You get the feeling they’ve invested more behind the scenes work into this building than its appearance lets on but it is all in line with the floor plans you had obtained earlier.\n\nThe contestant chooses a machete and briefly considers taking the elevator in the lobby before taking a left and following the first floor hall to a stairwell. Although poorly lit, he doesn’t encounter and surprises, nor do the feeds suggest anything is wrong until he makes it to the sixth floor. To his horror, he sees a sign that reads ‘''Stairwell A - NO ROOF/MAINTENANCE ACCESS''’ in bright, red letters. He keeps his resolve and bolts through the stairwell door only to literally run into the Masked Mamba himself.\n\nAdrenaline taking over and reorienting himself, the contestant swings his blade at his would-be executor. The Masked Mamba takes a step back, pivots, and uses the man’s momentum to toss him to the ground. The contestant scrambles forwards and to his feet as the hunter just stares him down. The man raises the machete above his head, screams, then rushes at the hunter and brings the blade down in a clean, cleaving motion towards his skull. The assailant crosses his arms over his head, blocking the edge, and actually shattering it as the contestant stumbles back in horror and disbelief.\n\n&quot;//Fuck,//&quot; you think to yourself. &quot;//They must have modified the plating in his suit from previous games after how things turned out in the earlier matches.//&quot;\n&lt;&lt;set $Contestants -= 1&gt;&gt;\nRun the Gauntlet’s resident ninja then swiftly snaps the contestants neck and walks away from the cameras and back into the darkness of the poorly lit halls.\n\nNow the last contestant left, you hope that the tracking chip in Mark the Masked Mamba’s ass is still functioning properly. You take a deep breath, grab your pack, and head for the entrance.\n\n[[You refuse to fail like the others|RTG4A2]]</div><div tiddler="RTG3.2C" tags="" created="201608190256" modifier="twee" twine-position="3510,5330">You decide not to shoot her; it does not seem sporting. You can’t believe you’re thinking about fair play after trying to throw her over the edge but you can’t deny your sense of honor. Now you suppose you will have to complete the course with no risk of being sniped. Of course, she may be stupid and fire her pistols towards you, but the chances of the bullets hitting you is laughable. You proceed along the course and head towards the goal, rifle in front in case she does get bold.\n\nYou are running the course and are amused to see a contestant scuttling slowly on their hands and knees across a walkway. Clearly not aware of what has happened to the huntress, her eyes almost pop out of her head when she sees you and the rifle.  She says something and you can’t quite make out what was said but make out the word ‘again’. You point the rifle towards where Crimson Talon is suffering to clue them in and the contestant stares up, again looks incredulous, then a sly smile appears on their face.\n\nYou peek through the scope and quickly ascertain that she’s struggling to reach a strut but the razor wire is spinning around and her hold is precarious. It finally snaps under the strain and she plummets while a camera drone goes into free fall with her. The sadistic producers sacrifice the camera drone to record the last moments of her pain for the audience.\n\nYou reckon that will satisfy the blood thirsty spectators and wonder what to do next. Any worry about how to proceed ends when the show producers make a quick decision and sound the end of round klaxon. All contestants are instructed to make their way immediately to the starting point due to continue to the final round due to unforeseen circumstances. \n\nWith your ideal positioning, you get their first and take the rifle with you. &lt;&lt;if $Contestants gte 2&gt;&gt;Another contestant looks at you worriedly and in a moment of shared camaraderie you beckon for them to go ahead of you. It may not have been the best for their nerves as when you reach the extraction point they are sweating profusely, clearly worried you’d kill them.\n\nStopping where you were told to wait, they mutter under their breath they think you must be a hunter in disguise to boost ratings. You say nothing and ignore the comment.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Somewhat to your surprise, you realize after waiting at the rendezvous point for over fifteen minutes that you must be the only contestant left alive. You're disappointed in the senseless loss of life and look forward to being done with this sadistic show.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\n\n[[Onwards to the final hurdle|RTG4][$Hunters -= 1]]</div><div tiddler="RTG3.2B" tags="" created="201608190256" modifier="twee" twine-position="3370,5330">The audience will go wild if Crimson Talon is executed by her own rifle, but simply shooting her is all too easy but shooting the razor wire holding the strut would be interesting. A couple of good shots could send the strut plummeting off and the huntress will be left dangling in extreme pain or finally succumb and fall. The first shot will certainly lead to some shock inducing vibrations from the razor wire itself.\n\nTo set the scene, you slowly take aim and watch as a number of camera drones head up towards her to make sure they have the best view. You take your first shot and hear the screams from as she dangles on for dear life. You grimace to yourself and she howls and you briefly consider just walking.\n\nIt’s then that you spot an escape option for Crimson Talon: dangling on the razor wire could allow her to get onto the roof of an adjoining building if it sinks slightly further. It would be a long jump from that height and likely break her leg but you know you would take the chance in her position. You take two more shots and the strut breaks away from the building. The weight of the strut tearing away and Crimson Talon slipping causes a domino effect as the razor wire breaks away from the other struts. The wire holding her finally tears free and she jumps at the last second to the other building and ends up out of your field of view.\n\nYou reckon that will still satisfy most of the blood thirsty spectators and wonder what to do next. Any worry about how to proceed ends when the show producers make a quick decision and sound the end of round klaxon. All remaining contestants are instructed to make their way immediately to the starting point due to continue to the final round due to unforeseen circumstances. With your ideal positioning, you get there first and take the rifle with you.\n\nOn your way to the meeting point, you briefly consider if it would have made for better ratings if she just plummeted twenty stories to her death right away. You shake your head; this show is rubbing off on you in the worst way. &lt;&lt;if $Contestants gte 2&gt;&gt;Once at the pick up point, younote that you aren't the only one to make it out with the Crimson Talon out of commission for good.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Once you make it to the pick up point, you realize you're alone. It doesn't appear you had been quick enough to finish off the Crimson Talon before she had taken out the other contestants.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\n\n[[One challenge left to go|RTG4]]</div><div tiddler="RTG3.2A" tags="" created="201608190256" modifier="twee" twine-position="3230,5330">The audience will go wild if Crimson Talon is executed by her own rifle. it is an easy shot and you know it will be a quick, clean kill. The ex-soldier in you suppresses any emotion as you take aim, let the on-board computer calculate the trajectory, adjust, then squeeze the trigger.\n\nOne shot is all it takes and the remains of Crimson Talon fall out of the razor wire and plummet to the ground. You worry briefly that another contestant may find her pistols. Would they even survive the fall?\n\nAny worry about how to proceed ends when the show producers make a quick decision and sound the end of round klaxon.

The man does not appear or walk past and a moment of doubt flickers into your mind. Were you being followed or is this man a professional? He may be calling for backup or armed and waiting for you to reveal yourself. You look around and consider your options.\n\nThere is a fire escape on one of the buildings which you could get up to but you aren’t sure where you would go from there. Your thoughts are interrupted when the man comes into view on the far side of the street that you were walking along. He looks directly down the alley and spots you. The man shows you his hands and beckons you over. There is no chance of an ambush now as the man has guessed what you would do and yet offered no threat. \n\nYou decide to walk closer to the man and get an idea of his intentions. You appraise the man; fit muscular build, hard looking and cold eyes. All-in-all you would guess that this man has killed in his lifetime. \n\nAs you approach the man speaks up. &quot;I know you killed two of the gang. I looked into it and I know why so don’t bother lying to me. What I don't get is why you are here, doing this. People with your skill level are usually working for someone.&quot; This guy must be the gang enforcer, checking to see if a rival gang is working in on their turf. \n\n&quot;I'm a free-lance offworld mercenary for hire,&quot; you reply. &quot;I don’t work for anyone.&quot;\n\nThe man takes this in and after a few more questions he invites you to a chat with his boss. There will be no lost feelings over the death of the two street thugs, they are expendable, but he will want to know of you and your talents. You agree to meet up with him. Access to street thugs could be useful and if they are on to your life could get difficult. You wouldn’t be surprised if your apartment was located in their territory. \n\n[[Get to your destination|$DTdest]] &lt;&lt;set $DTR to 4&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;set $Int11 to &quot;True&quot;&gt;&gt;</div></div>
