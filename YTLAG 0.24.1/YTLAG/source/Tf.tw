::Masturbate Day 4
You've been feeling really stressed out lately, and you haven't had any release.<<if visited("Shower Masturbate Female")>> What you did in the shower didn't count.<</if>> Besides, you're really curious. You'd always heard that a female orgasm is way better than a male one. You're pretty sure that's not true. The orgasms you had when you had a dick were amazing.

Patrick and Marco aren't in your room when you get back. @@.thought;Perfect.@@ You lock your door, plop down on the bed, and pull up your favorite porn site.

@@.thought;What's it going to be?@@ A thumbnail on the front page catches your attention. It's a picture of two naked girls in the shower. You quickly click on it.

In an instant, your <<print $player.pants.informalName>> are unbuttoned and down at your feet, and your shirt is on the floor. You always masturbated naked. It would be so embarrassing to get jizz on your school uniform. @@.thought;Although I guess I don't have that problem anymore. Oh well, the clothes are already off.@@

That leaves you standing in only your <<print $player.underwear.informalName>>. For some reason, they feel //wrong// on your body. They're quickly off as well, leaving you totally naked. Luckily, the blinds are closed.

::Masturbate Day 4 Watch
//The video starts, and you find yourself transfixed by it. A short, perky blonde girl is taking a shower. Her right hand is between her legs, fingering her pussy. Her eyes are closed, and she's smiling.//

Your right hand drifts between your legs, mirroring her. Except you can't bring yourself to finger your pussy yet. It does feel really good, though. In science class a couple years ago, you were supposed to learn about the female anatomy, but you hadn't paid attention. When you had sex with a girl, you didn't need to know what the different parts of her vagina was. All you felt you needed to know was where her pussy was, and that you were fucking it.

//The blonde girl's partner has joined her in the shower. She's a tall brunette, with large, firm breasts and a mischievous smile. The blonde drops to her knees, and buries her face in the brunette's vagina, which is shown through a series of close ups.//

As you rub your pussy, tracing its soft folds, you imagine the blonde girl licking it. You're sure it would be the best feeling ever. Tentatively, you slide your index finger inside your pussy, and give out an un-masculine sounding moan. You're wet.

//The brunette is really getting into it, and her last moan occured at the same time as yours. She throws her head back and cries out as the blonde increases her pace.//

As the brunette nears orgasm, you imagine yourself in your dorm shower, as this cute blonde eats you out. Without thinking, you stick your index finger deeper, and are met with immediate resistance. @@.thought;So I'm a virgin.@@ Quickly, your finger retreats to a shallower area. You don't feel like popping your own cherry. As you shift your finger around, it finds your clit, and you let out a moan, even louder than your last. You don't care though. It feels so good.

//With a final cry, the brunette orgasms.// @@.thought;That must have felt so nice. I'd love to be her.@@ Wait, what? You don't want to be her. You're a guy! You just want to be eaten out by that blonde.

//While you're struggling internally, the blonde and the brunette have switched places. The blonde seems to be in heaven as she enjoys the brunette's expert tongue. Sometime between shots, the shower has been switched off.//

You're too busy to notice inconsistencies though. You're rubbing your clit, closing your eyes and shivering. Your body shifts back and forth on the bed, trying to get into the position to give you the most pleasure.

A warm feeling envelops your body from head to toe. You're getting close to an orgasm. Part of you is scared to experience a female orgasm for the first time, but there's no way you're removing your finger.

You're imagining yourself in the shower again, in the blonde's position, being eaten out by a cute brunette girl. And then the brunette is replaced by a black-haired guy. @@.thought;What?@@ But he's an expert at this, and you imagine yourself moaning as you enjoy his expert tongue.

And then it happens. Your muscles clench, your head hits the pillow, and you squeal as the orgasm takes over your body.

You smile and sink into the bed, lost in the post-orgasm bliss. It was amazing, definitely on par with any orgasm you had when you had a dick. You don't know if it was //better//, but maybe you weren't doing it right.

@@.thought;Wait@@ you think, sitting up suddenly. The scene you were imagining when you climaxed plays in your head. You in the shower, getting your pussy licked. By a man. @@.thought;Why was it a man? I watched a lesbian video. I'm not gay!@@

@@.thought;Well, why does it matter if it was a man or a woman?@@ you try to rationalize. @@.thought;He was servicing //me//. If he was fucking me or I was sucking his dick, then it would be gay.@@ It's not very manly to get your pussy licked, but that's not your fault.

Suddenly, you feel a draft on your naked skin. But how is that possible? The windows are shut, and you didn't change the thermostat.

The draft gets more intense, and you realize that it's only affecting your body. It's like the heat that washed over you when you were about to orgasm, except this is ice cold. And it feels wrong.

You settle back into your bed and check the clock. You've still got some time before practice starts. @@.thought;I can watch that show that <<print $girlfriend.firstname>> was always talking about.@@

The show is disappointing. It's only the first episode, of course, but it's just another show about catty high school girls. Still, you manage to make it halfway through.

You're saved from the rest of it when Marco and Patrick walk in. Marco does a double take when he sees you. @@.male;"Oh, hi, <<print $player.firstname>>. Are you coming to practice?"@@

@@.male;"Come on man, just because you won us the game doesn't mean you can be late."@@

@@.player;"I'm coming, I'm coming."@@

<<if visited("New Face")>>@@.thought;Marco did a double take. Are the changes that easy to spot? Is anyone else going to notice? At least Patrick didn't seem to notice anything.@@<<else>>@@.thought;What was with that look Marco gave me? I was sitting in my own bed. It's got to be because I was running late, right? Patrick didn't react at all.@@<</if>>

::Masturbate 2
Alright! You lie back in bed and open your computer, eager to find some new porn. Suddenly, you're hit with a disturbing thought. @@.thought;Wait. The last time I did this, something happened to my face.@@

That thought sends you into a panic. Sure, it's probably a coincidence, but what if they're linked? What if pleasuring yourself makes your face change again?

@@.thought;No, it's just a coincidence. Really. Maybe it had something to do with the curse, or maybe <<print $witch.firstname>> said a spell right at that time@@ you tell yourself. @@.thought;What else am I supposed to do? Not masturbate for a couple months? I'd go crazy!@@

[[You're overthinking it, and you need release. Find some porn.|Masturbate 2 Start]]
<<link "There's no way you're taking that chance." $tfRecoverPassage>><</link>>

::Masturbate 2 Start
You're a little uneasy, but you find some porn and press play. You have the room to yourself, and this is a perfect time. Soon, your uneasy feeling disappears as you get into the video.

@@.thought;What's it going to be?@@ A thumbnail on the front page catches your attention. It's an image of a sexy maid lying on her back, stuffed with a big dick.

@@.thought;Perfect.@@ You click on it, and the video starts. //A hot brunette dressed in casual clothes is cleaning an apartment. She seems to be dusting the same places again and again, but that's not your concern.//

You tear off your <<print $player.pants.informalName>> and <<print $player.underwear.informalName>> and start rubbing yourself, looking at the maid's round bottom, and imagining having your way with her.

//A young, blond guy enters the room. @@.male;"You call this cleaning?"@@

@@.female;"I'm sorry, sir. What did I do wrong?"@@

@@.male;"You're a maid. You should dress like one."@@ He flings a maid's uniform onto the bed. The brunette holds it up against herself. It's clearly way too short and way too low cut.//

You slip a finger inside of your pussy and cry out in pleasure. You close your eyes as the video keeps playing, imagining that you're that man, and you have a sexy, scantily clad maid who will do whatever you want.

//@@.female;"Okay!"@@ the maid says, and strips down to her black bra and panties right in front of her employer.//

@@.thought;Seriously? This is so cheesy!@@ You don't close the video, though. Instead, you keep fingering yourself, even harder than before.

//The woman is now dressed in her skimpy maid uniform. She bends to pick a sock up off the floor, exposing her black panties. While she is doing this, the man checks out her ass.//

Unfortunately, the next minute of the video is just the maid cleaning. You're starting to get bored.

[[Skip ahead to the good part|Masturbate 2 Orgasm]]
<<setUpSexScene>><<set $player.pants to null>><<set $player.underwear to null>><<set $player.shirt to null>><<set $player.bra to null>>

::Masturbate 2 Orgasm
Bored, you skip ahead. //The man's cock is out, and the maid is already naked.

@@.male;"Get on the bed,"@@ the man says. The woman complies, lying on the freshly made bed.//

You imagine what it would be like to have a beautiful woman like that who does whatever you say. You would make her clean your room (it is getting a little messy), and then you'd strip her naked and fuck her with your big cock.

Abruptly, you stop fingering yourself. You don't have a big cock anymore, and after only <<print $day-3>> <<if $day is 4>>day<<else>>days<</if>> with your new vagina, you're finding it a little harder to imagine what it would be like to do the fucking.

//The man commands her to start masturbating, and she does so. She's lying on the bed, naked, fingering her pussy. Her eyes are closed, and she is moaning with delight.//

You lie on your own bed and start fingering your own pussy. Your finger finds your clitoris and a cry escapes your lips.

It's disturbingly easy to identify as her. You're in the same position, doing the same thing. And it's not even gay. The man's not in the picture right now, you're just masturbating. There's nothing wrong with that...

//The man lies down on top of the maid. He grabs her head and gives her a long, forceful kiss. The maid smiles and guides his cock to her dripping wet cunt.//

Now you're finding it harder to identify with the woman. She's getting fucked, and you don't want that! But she looks so fulfilled, her body moving in time with his thrusts, as she nears orgasm.

In spite of yourself, you keep fingering yourself. It's wrong, you don't want to be imagining getting fucked. But now that your finger has found your clitoris, you don't want to move it away. Your breath is ragged, and you feel a heat building up in your body.//

With a final cry, the maid orgasms. She looks so content, having just gotten fucked by her dominant, well-hung boss.//

At the same time, you climax. It's a mind-blowing, amazing, feeling but you can't fully enjoy it. You're too disturbed. @@.thought;I was identifying with the maid. And I came at the same time as her.@@

You've felt post-orgasm guilt when you had a dick before, but it's nothing compared to this. It's wrong, and you shouldn't have done it, but it //felt so good//. @@.thought;It was just a really good video@@ you decide.

Before you can think about it more, a familiar feeling washes over you.

::Masturbate Day 4 Change
The cold continues to get more intense. It feels like someone dunked your body in a pool of ice water. Your body has gone numb, and you're helpless to do anything except wait.

The cold disappears, thankfully. You can now feel your body again! Except, something still seems wrong. Specifically, your face. You can still feel it, but it feels strangely different.

Once again, your body has gone ice cold. You freeze, remembering the first change, and dreading what's going to happen. Even if you didn't freeze, though, it wouldn't have done much good. Your entire body is numb.

The cold gets more intense, and you brace yourself, waiting for it to drift upwards and concentrate in your head. You picture yourself with a more androgynous face. @@.thought;Fuck! This can't happen! Will anyone recognize me?@@

To your surprise, the cold moves downward, leaving your head entirely. Your joy at not having your face changed is quickly replaced with worry about what's going to change instead.

That question is soon answered. The cold concentrates around your waist, and then in your ass. It feels different now, and you jump out of bed, trying to twist your head to see what's happening.

Before you can check, the cold is gone. Your body feels normal. Well, most of your body, anyway. You're still not sure what happened to your butt.

You're morbidly curious where it's going to centralize. That'll show you which part of your body is going to be changed next. Maybe it'll be your face. Or your legs. No, the feeling is already too high.

Slowly, it centralizes in your chest. @@.thought;No!@@ The cold gets very intense, and then suddenly stops.

Your body is no longer numb, and you take advantage of the opportunity to inspect the damage. You don't have boobs, thank god. But your nipples are really sensitive, and just touching them sends a tiny jolt of pleasure through your body. They also seem a little bigger, but maybe that's just your imagination.

<</if>>Now there's nothing you can do except wait.

The feeling seems to be getting higher and higher. It goes above your waist, and you worry that it's going to give you boobs, but it skips over your chest and centralizes in your face.

No, not your face. In...your neck?

It gets intense, more intense than before, and you feel short of breath. You take a short breath, then another, and then the feeling disappears.

The sensation pushes outward, running down each arm until finally reaching your hand. It becomes intense, and you wish for it to be over.

And then it is. Your body feels normal again, except...wait, what about your hands? You look at them closely. The thumbs are slightly longer, the hair is slightly finer, and the other fingers are slightly smaller.

@@.thought;Why did I have to let this happen? Why can't I act more manly?@@

Not here!@@<</if>> You can hide changes to the other parts of you, and you feel that you've done that pretty well. There's no hiding your face, though. Everyone who looks at you is going to see it.

And then the tingling continues upward, passing over your face entirely.

You don't feel like celebrating yet, however. <<if $player.controlQuestKnowledge is true>>Your hair hasn't been transformed yet, and you don't think it's going to be anything good. @@.thought;Is it going to give me long hair?

As if it can hear you, the cold moves quickly up your body, stopping by your throat. It intensifies and you feel your adam's apple shrinking, and your vocal chords reshaping.

You wait for the cold to reshape your fingers to look more feminine, but instead it slowly moves past them, all the way to the tips of your fingers.

From this angle, you can't see what's happening. You desperately want to move your fingers up to your face, but your body is frozen in place.

The cold becomes intense and your fingers become tingly, and then it's over.

You jerk your left hand up to your face, and look it over. Your hand looks the same as before, but the nails have grown out.

Your nails have been long before, when you forgot to cut them. Then, they looked dirty and unkempt. Now, your nails are different. They're neat and filed, just longer.

The cold, numb feeling settles into your hair and pushes down. You can't really see what's happening but you know that your hair is being lengthened.

As it descends, you're able to see it out of the corner of your eye. It's an unsettling feeling to watch your hair lengthen of its own accord, and it's all you can do to hold your breath and pray it stops soon.

::Ass3 Lean
As you lean against the wall, trying to decide what to do about your situation, you notice something strange. You're leaning the way you normally would, but something feels off. Your butt is more padded now, almost like you have miniature pillows inside of it. You shift around, trying to get comfortable.

@@.thought;This is going to take some getting used to.@@

You stand back up. Better to stand than to be reminded of your transformation. But you can't put it out of your mind completely. Before you realize it, your hand is squeezing your butt. There's definitely a lot more flesh here.

You try to think back to your girlfriends' butts. Your butt feels a lot like theirs. Not as rounded, but if you didn't know any better, you would guess that it belonged to a female.

<<if $tfCircumstances.extraClothing is "one piece">>You lean back against the wall, but as you shift around, you notice some tightness in your swimsuit. You stand back up and examine it.

::Boobs3
The familiar feeling is back. You try your best to relax as it washes over you and creeps up your body. You've long since learned that you can't fight it, and it's even a little bit exciting to see how much you've changed.

@@.thought;Why did I think that? No, it's not exciting. It's terrifying.@@

As you're arguing with yourself, the feeling has made its way up your body and has centralized in your chest. You were looking straight at your small breasts when you went numb, so you're able to watch as the transformation happens.

Your boobs are expanding. Before, they were small and easy to hide. But as they slowly expand, you get a sinking feeling that it won't be possible to hide them anymore.

You tentatively massage your new, larger boobs. They're so sensitive, and just that one touch makes your pussy tingle.

The feeling creeps its way up your body, splitting in two once it gets to your shoulders, and then sliding down each arm. You can feel it molding and shaping your fingers.

Before your eyes, your fingers are becoming thinner and the veins in your hands are getting harder to see. The feeling moves up into the very tips of your fingers, and they start to tingle.

The feeling disappears, and you move your hands in front of your face, palms facing away from you. Your nails have grown longer, but they're not unkempt or dirty. Now, there's no mistaking them for female nails. @@.thought;How am I going to play football now?@@

Your body grows cold and numb, and you hold your breath, waiting for the transformation to start.

@@.thought;My butt is already so feminine. How can it get even girlier?@@

You suspect that you're soon about to find out. The coldness creeps up your body, stopping once it gets to your waist.

Its tendrils, thin and snaking, creep downwards. You can feel it massaging and molding your ass.

You're more concerned about what the rest of it is doing, however. The other part of the coldness is staying on your waist, wrapping around it and squeezing.

The breath is sucked out of you as your waist narrows. If you could, you would let out a sigh. Even though you've gotten used to the transformations by now, you're ready for this one to be over.

It's not. The coldness creeps to your hips, and you can feel them expanding, and expanding<<if $player.pants is null or $tfCircumstances.extraClothing is "naked" or $player.isWearingDress>>.

You can't deal with that train of thought.

As the cold starts to overtake your body, you focus your energy on your feet. You're not sure whether it's working, but the cold slowly starts working its way downward.

@@.thought;Yes!@@

The cold continues moving downwards, running down your legs, and passing over your knees and ankles. Finally, it gets to your feet and starts to intensify.

@@.thought;Okay! Now it'll make my feet more girly, but nobody will notice because nobody can see my feet!@@ If you were able to smile, you would be doing so. For the first time, you feel like you outsmarted the transformation.

It continues pushing and pushing. Something is happening to your foot, you know that much, but you're not sure what.

@@.thought;Last time they became hairless and smaller...Are they going to get even smaller?@@

The coldness disappears, and you struggle to gain your balance. At first, you assume that's because your feet were numb and you suddenly regained feeling in them. But as you continue to struggle, you realize that something is wrong.
