You follow him inside. <<print $witch.firstname>> is sitting cross-legged on a bed, looking at you with a weird combination of anger and anxiety. She has dark circles under her eyes and unkempt hair.

The ride is uneventful. There's a few other students on the bus, but they're either talking to each other or playing on their phone. Nobody approaches you, and you're glad about that.

The bus pulls to a stop and you get out. Only now do you realize that you have no idea where to go. You've gone out to town with your friends sometimes, but the only places you've stopped have been the movie theater and some of the restaraunts.

In desperation, you pull out your phone and try to search for places selling razors, but the only results that come up are miles away.

You wander around town for an hour, hoping to stumble upon the right store. When you came here with your friends, it seemed like a typical quiet, sleepy small town but now that you have to actually search through it, you're overwhelmed by the sheer number of stores.

Your feet are getting sore, and you're feeling tired. Maybe it was a mistake to try to find this by yourself. Maybe it's not even here. @@.thought;But it has to be, right? All the girls here shave their legs. There has to be some place selling these razors.@@

You break out into a smile. This is the first person you stopped, and not only did he know where to go, but he was going to take you there! You eagerly follow behind him.

As you enter the mall, you start to experience doubt. This guy doesn't look like the type to work at a store selling womens razors. @@.thought;Maybe they sell razors for everyone.@@

He leads you to the store, and your heart sinks. This is a store for men. It's not going to have the kind of razor you're looking for.

Oblivious to your disappointment, he guides you to a rack and hands you a men's razor. @@.male;"This is our most popular razor."@@

You take an open seat on the shuttle and put the razor underneath your leg. You're sure that nobody can see it, but you feel like everyone is looking at you.

At one point during the ride, you feel like there are a pair of eyes on you, but when you look around, the only people nearby are busy talking to each other.

Finally, you're back on campus. There are a couple of students milling about. Nobody's noticed you, yet. But if you stride in carrying a girl's razor, that will probably change.

@@.thought;Now I just have to get back to my dorm.@@ You look around. Your dorm is across the quad. You stick the razor in your pocket and then pull your shirt down so it covers it.

@@.thought;Okay, hopefully this is good enough.@@ You hurriedly walk across the quad, and then you're in the dorm. Nobody called out to you and you didn't hear any laughter. It's gone well so far.

Now you have to do the actual shaving part.

You step inside one of the shower stalls and close the curtains. Next, you drop your <<print $player.pants.informalName>> and your <<print $player.underwear.informalName>>.

You put the razor flat against your skin.

You press down with the razor. Taking a deep breath, you bring the razor upwards.

It's hard to get rid of the hair at first. But after several tries, it starts to fall to the shower floor.

You're getting the hang of this, and to your surprise, it's actually quite...well, fun isn't the right word. But you haven't been taking good care of yourself since that fateful day in the locker room, and it feels good to be grooming yourself again.

Suddenly, you feel a coldness come over you. You already know what that means.

@@.thought;I'll just fix the right leg.@@

You pick the razor back up and run it over your leg, shaving it until it is completely smooth. In the back of your mind, you're wondering why you're doing this, but you're really getting the hang of it, and you're getting a feeling of satisfaction seeing the hair fall out.

It takes a while but you finish your right leg. You look down, evaluating your handiwork. The right leg looks good: there are some hairs that you missed but you don't feel like correcting it. Overall though, it looks soft and smooth and if you saw it on a girl, you would be turned on.

The left leg is a different story. It looks normal for the old you, but its hairiness starkly contrasts with your other leg. Together, it looks almost comical.

Before you can stop yourself, you've picked up the razor again and you've started shaving your left leg. It doesn't take quite as long as the right, but it still takes a while. This is still unfamiliar to you.

@@.thought;Maybe I could ask <<print $girlfriend.firstname>> for tips. No, this was a one time thing! Wait, why did I even do it this one time?@@

You can't deny that it looks good, though. Your legs are matched perfectly and you start feeling yourself get turned on.

The left leg is a different story. It looks normal for the old you, but its hairiness starkly contrasts with your other leg. Together, it looks almost comical.

<<print $witch.firstname>> sees where you're looking. @@.witch;"Want me to shave that leg? Because you look ridiculous."@@

@@.player;"Gee, thanks,"@@ you say, but you nod.

She picks up the razor again, and starts shaving your left leg. This time, you watch your leg as the hair disappears. <<print $witch.firstname>>'s touch seems to have gotten friskier too, but you figure that everything just feels more sensual now that you don't have any hair covering your leg.

Her teasing has picked back up again. @@.witch;"If I saw you from the waist down, I'd think you were a girl,"@@ she needles. You flinch, suspecting that she's right. You can't see how you look from someone else's point of view, but it probably isn't very manly.

You can't deny that it looks good, though. Your legs are matched perfectly and you start feeling yourself get turned on.

You're getting another feeling too.

[[Get in|Witch Bra Ride]]

::Witch Bra Ride
You're content to just ride to the mall in silence. The familiar sights of the campus pass by, and you soon find yourself getting bored. You glance over at <<print $witch.firstname>> in the front seat. She's your only conversation partner.

Finally, you decide to ask her a question.

[[Why are you helping me?|Witch Bra Ride Help]]

@@.player;"But you're the one who did this to me,"@@ you point out.

@@.witch;"I didn't want it to go like this..."@@

@@.player;"But you still cursed me. You wanted to hurt me. And you seemed pretty mad back in the locker room."@@

She sighs. @@.witch;"Okay, yeah, I cursed you. I'm sorry about that. Can we move on?"@@

@@.player;"Sure,"@@ you say, wondering whether you should just back off. @@.player;"But it's just, I don't know, weird for you to go from cursing me to helping me out."@@

@@.witch;"I'm going to be shopping too. I can get something for my spells, I can help you get your bra."@@

@@.player;"Yeah, my bra,"@@ you say. For a second, you had forgotten why you were going on this trip. @@.thought;<<print $witch.firstname>> made me shave my legs too. Whenever she helps me, why is it always about something girly?@@

<<print $witch.firstname>> seems a little pissed off, but you're proud that you stood up for yourself. It's not something you've done a lot lately. You're okay with having a silent drive, too.

As soon as you get used to the silent drive, <<print $witch.firstname>> turns to you.

@@.witch;"[[I have an idea|Witch Bra Idea]]"@@ she says.

::Witch Bra Ride Mall
@@.player;"What are you going to do at the mall?"@@

@@.witch;"I'm going to help you find a bra,"@@ she says simply. @@.witch;"You've never worn a bra, right?"@@

You shake your head, blushing.

@@.witch;"Then you'd be lost without me. You wouldn't know what to look for."@@

@@.player;"Thanks,"@@ you say, although you're still confused why she's doing this. @@.player;"That's nice of you to help."@@

She laughs. @@.witch;"No. Back how you're like now."@@

@@.player;"Oh,"@@ you say, disappointed.

@@.thought;It's a good idea though. I can buy a bra and nobody will recognize me. It'll be an hour of looking just like a girl in exchange for not completely killing my social life. If I can trust <<print $witch.firstname>>, that is.@@

@@.thought;Wait. If I agree to this, does that count as me //accepting// being a girl?"@@

@@.player;"Can I get transformed from this?"@@ you ask. It's a good idea, and you're interested in how it would feel, although you would never admit that. Still, you're worried. You've transformed whenever you //accepted// being a girl, and you're pretty sure that voluntarily pushing your transformation all the way to the end would count as accepting it.

@@.witch;"Hmm,"@@ she says. @@.witch;"I didn't think of that. I guess it could."@@

@@.player;"Then I don't want it!"@@

Her face lights up. @@.witch;"But if I do it for you, then you didn't //choose// this. And you won't transform!"@@

@@.thought;I just told her I didn't want to be transformed, and she's doing it anyway! I hope it really is only for an hour.@@

<<print $witch.firstname>> is already starting to chant. Instinctively, you close your eyes.

@@.witch;"Keep his masculinity at bay

You feel like you've been punched in the gut. At the same time, your extremities start to tingle, as if they're ready to change and are waiting for <<print $witch.firstname>> to finish her chant.

::Witch Bra Stopped
Fortunately, <<print $witch.firstname>> has the presence of mind to slam on the breaks before she falls unconscious. That does little to ease your worries, though. Your car is stopped in the middle of the road!

You lean over and put the car into park, and then open your door. You'd have to go to a mirror to see yourself, but the view you have is almost as scary as the fact that you're im the middle of the street.

Your now baggy <<print $player.pants.informalName>> billow out, blowing with the wind. They're too loose and too long, and you have to hold onto them to stop them from falling down. The only part of your pants that actually fits is the ass.

As you walk around to the drivers side, you keep having to brush your long blonde hair out of your face, which is even more challenging when one of your hands is holding up your pants. @@.thought;A girl would tie it back in a ponytail on a day like today. But my hair is loose.@@

A car speeds by, swerving onto the other side of the road to avoid <<print $witch.firstname>>'s car. Its horn honks angrily at you as it passes. @@.thought;I'd better get going.@@

Setting your mind back to the task at hand, you attempt to push <<print $witch.firstname>> into the passenger seat. It's no use.

@@.thought;I'm never going to be able to move <<print $witch.firstname>> on my own.@@

The man chuckles. @@.male;"What happened?"@@

@@.player;"Um, she had...too much to drink?"@@ you lie.

The man looks at you with a raised eyebrow. @@.male;"You girls from Pinewood?"@@

You nod, not wanting to have a conversation with this guy. For the first time, you realize how vulnerable you are. As far as he's concerned, you're a young woman on an empty road with an unconscious friend.

@@.male;"I can move her into the backseat,"@@ he offers. You nod, trying to avoid hearing the sound of your voice again.

He walks past you, and easily hoists <<print $witch.firstname>> over his shoulder, and sets her down in the backseat.

He walks back to his car, and you start to get into the driver's seat. Out of instinct, you look behind you. The man is looking straight at you. No, not at you. At your butt. When he realizes that you caught him, he blushes and looks away.

When he gets into his car and pulls away, you let out a breath.

You can't help yourself. Your eyes drift up to the rearview mirror, locking onto the face of a nervous blonde girl.

For a moment you're confused. Who is she, and how did she get in this car?

Then it dawns on you. The girl gulps. You take a moment to study her. She has long blonde hair, a smooth, feminine face, and soft blue eyes.

It feels extremely alien to be looking in the mirror and see her face, but it also feels familiar somehow. If you had a twin sister, you imagine that she'd look similar to this.

[[Back|Witch Bra Drive]]

You text <<print $witch.firstname>> that you're done and head over to her car. She's not there, and you're left with no choice but to wait there for her to show up.

A hot blast of air hits you, and your body goes numb. The hotness encases your body, but it doesn't feel unpleasant. It feels like you just stepped into a warm shower. You know that you're changing, but you can't tell what's going on. There are too many things happening at once, and you can't keep track of them all.

She looks surprised. @@.female;"Grateful?"@@

@@.player;"Yeah. I, um, never wear feminine clothing. I told <<print $witch.firstname>> that I would wear a dress, but I probably would have backed out."@@

@@.witch;"I knew it!"@@

@@.female;"How do you like the dress, now that you're wearing it?"@@

@@.player;"I guess,"@@ you say. You're trying not to sound too girly, but the smile on your face gives you away. @@.player;"I hope <<print $qb.firstname>> likes it. The only thing is, well, it's just kind of short."@@

@@.witch;"I've been, uh, not very nice to you. I guess I judged you. And then I got to know you more, and you were nice. I guess that's why I wanted to help get you ready for your date. I wanted to make it up to you. And I just made you want to cry."@@

You're speechless. <<print $witch.firstname>> has never been so honest or apologetic with you before. You feel like you should reassure her.

@@.player;"I'm okay. Thank you for apologizing, but you don't need to feel bad. I didn't like feeling trapped, but, uh, you were probably right. If I could have worn my regular clothes, I probably would have."@@
