The project doesn't go well. Everyone has a different vision for the project, and nobody can agree. Finally, it's decided that everyone will just do research for today, and figure out what to do later.

[[Get started|Panty Raid Start]]

::Panty Raid Start
You're grinning as you and the other boys walk across campus. You feel a warm breeze across your skin, and you're looking forward to the rain, your dream all but forgotten.

There are two girls dorms, and the team splits into two. You're in a group with <<print $qb.firstname>>, Marco, Patrick, Everett, and some other guys.

Your group walks into the dorm with no problem. The door's unlocked, and anyone can get in. @@.thought;Not good security@@ you think with a grin.

You look around. Nobody seems to be here. @@.thought;I didn't know everyone was so busy on a thursday night.@@

@@.player;"Okay,"@@ you whisper loudly. @@.player;"Every man for himself!"@@

With those words, everyone splits off. Some boys run down the hallway, some boys take the stairs, but everyone makes a lot of noise as they ransack the dorm. @@.thought;What was the point of sneaking in?@@ you wonder.

You're left alone in the hallway, the sounds of the panty raid echoing all around you.

It bothers you that you hesitated. You used to be one of those guys. When you imagined taking part in the raid, you imagined yourself drunkenly raiding random girls's rooms, collecting your prizes and high-fiving the other guys. Yet here you are, standing awkwardly in the hallway.

@@.thought;Okay, I should pick a room@@ you think. Cautiously, you step forward. The door is slightly ajar. You peer in. Two girls are on the bed, doing each other's nails.

@@.thought;Sam said we shouldn't hit rooms that weren't empty@@ you remember. You look around some more, spotting three rooms you don't think have been touched. All three doors are firmly shut, and there's no light coming from underneath the door.

@@.thought;Perfect! But which door should I pick? They all look the same.@@

You glance at the names on the doors. Sophie...<<print $witch.firstname>>...Candice. @@.thought;Wait, <<print $witch.firstname>>?@@ You spin around. There aren't many <<print $witch.firstname>>s in this school. This is definitely her room.

You're not going to mess around with <<print $witch.firstname>>'s room. You remember what happened when she caught you staring at her during class. Getting caught snooping in her room would be way worse.

You try one of the non-<<print $witch.firstname>> doors. It's locked. You try the other door. Success! It slowly swings open, revealing a dimly lit room.

You shut the door behind you, and reach for the light switch. For a second, you can't find it, and you start to panic. Moments later, your fingers bump something, and the room is lit up by an old halogen light.

@@.thought;Calm down@@ you tell yourself. @@.thought;This is just a normal girl's room. Man, if I went for <<print $witch.firstname>>'s room, I'd be a nervous wreck..@@

Once you've calmed down, you finally look around. The first thing you see is the set of dressers. Three of them are pushed against the wall in a line. @@.thought;That's where their panties are, obviously.@@ You glance at the rest of the room. There's beds and desks, but not much besides that. It's pretty sparse. There are no decorations, and the closet is mostly bare.

Deciding to look closer, you climb into the first bed, and look under the covers and under the pillow. Nothing. Just to be sure, you search the other two beds too.

The only thing you find are that the beds in the girls dorm are much more comfortable than the beds in the boys dorm.

@@.thought;Well, that was a waste.@@ You look back and feel a little bad. You messed up their beds, just because you thought you might find something. It takes a little bit of time to remake their beds, but you feel better about yourself when you're done. @@.thought;Why did I do that? They could have easily done that themselves.

As you dig to the bottom of the pile, a doodle catches your eye. You pick it up and take a closer look. There are a couple drawings. One doodle is of a stick figure standing outside of what looks like a closet. Underneath that is a drawing of the clothes reaching for the stick figure.

You're not sure whether it's bravery or foolishness. But whatever it is, you open the wardrobe. You can't embarrass yourself by returning to your teammates empty-handed, after all.

You glance around, looking for Elvira's panties. @@.thought;There!@@ you think, spotting a pair of lacey purple panties.

You reach your hand towards them, but something weird happens. The panties fly past your outstretched arm, and...up your legs?

You look down and see that you're no longer wearing your <<print $player.pants.informalName>> or your <<print $player.underwear.informalName>>. They're lying crumpled on the floor, and you're standing butt naked in a witch's room.

The gravity of your situation washes over you, and you start to panic. You've got to get out of here. Now.

@@.thought;Please let me reach the door!@@ You've almost reached it...your hand is on the doorknob...you swing the door open and collapse on the floor.

You realize two things. One: you're in public, completely naked except for a pair of panties halfway up your legs. Two: the clothes have followed you into the hallway.

You're not naked for very long. The panties quickly rise up your legs and settle into place. @@.thought;At least if someone walks by, they won't see my pussy.@@ Next is a lacey purple bra. It settles onto your chest and clasps itself shut behind your back.

Behind you, someone laughs loudly.

You spin around and see a football player, one of the receivers. He's carrying two pairs of panties in his hand. You curse your luck. How did he successfully get panties while you went for a witch's room and were forced to //wear// panties?

You trail off, realizing that he's left. It's just as well, as at that moment the clothes start attacking you again. A pink princess dress descends on you, passing over your head and body. There's a zipping sound behind you as it zips itself up.

Finally, everything seems still. The only articles of clothing left are a pair of white stockings, and a garter belt, and they're not moving.

::Panty Raid Elvira Fight
You look to the hallway. You want to run away, but right now you're naked except for the panties that are creeping up your legs. You definitely don't want to face anyone while you're dressed like this.

You take hold of the panties and try to force them down your legs. The panties push back with an equal intensity, but you slowly manage to lower them.

At the same time, however, a matching lacey purple bra flies at your chest and starts to wrap around it. Both of your hands are busy tugging the panties down, and you're forced to move a hand up to fend off the bra.

Unfortunately, you're not strong enough to hold off these clothes with one hand. Maybe before, but not now. The panties settle in, covering your crotch, and the purple bra clasps shut behind your back.

Just when you think it's over, a pink princess dress descends on you, trying to pass over your head. You fight valiantly, but the dress is strong. And with it over your head, it's impossible to see anything.

The dress zips itself up, and the clothes go quiet. The only clothes left are a pair of white stockings and a garter belt, and they're not moving. The wardrobe looks normal, and if it wasn't for what you just experienced, you would have never guessed that there was anything special about this room.

You start to back away, but as soon as you lift your foot off the ground, the white stockings fly towards you and slide up your feet. At the same time, a garter belt wraps around your waist and fastens the stockings.

The stockings feel weird and tight against your legs. You're used to wearing baggy pants. You're not used to having something caress your legs so intimately.

But it's not as if the stockings feel pleasant. They feel scratchy and uncomfortable, probably because of your hairy legs. @@.thought;I'm...I mean girls... are not supposed to have hair when I'm wearing stockings.@@

::Panty Raid Elvira Aroused
You can't explain it. This shouldn't be turning you on. You should be turned on at the thought of seeing a girl in a cute princess dress, not at the thought of you wearing that girly dress!

But here you are, completely alone, wearing a dress and lingerie. You feel very feminine, but it's not exactly a bad feeling. You reach down to feel Elvira's panties, and they're already wet.

You imagine <<if visited("Panty Raid Elvira Seen")>>a strong football player finding you dressed like this and undressing you<<else>>Elvira coming in and having her way with you<</if>>. Despite yourself, you're becoming more and more turned on.

A pair of unseen gloves fly towards you. @@.thought;I've got to put my hands in my pockets!@@ Instinctively, you slide your hands down to where your pockets would be, only to realize that you're wearing a dress.

The gloves have almost made their way to you, and you brace for them to slide up your hands and complete the outfit. But instead of flying straight, they go down.

You're less confused when you feel a pair of hands at your sex. They play with it, and tease it. You stifle a yelp. You don't want anyone to hear you. Then one finger of the glove slips inside, and you care much less. 

Despite it being an empty glove, it feels like an actual hand. You buck your hips to the rhythm of the glove, trying desperately to get off. <<if $player.arousal>=50>>Finally, you can feel an orgasm coming. Your knees shake, and you reach out and grip the wall for support. It feels good to<<if $player.arousal>95>> finally<</if>> get off. While you're busy recovering, the gloves slide up your arms.

You ask for her to turn around, and she obliges. @@.thought;Her back's turned! I could just hit her over the head. No, that's a bad idea.@@

You quickly unzip the dress and roll the stockings down your legs. The bra is a little bit harder, but you finally manage to unhook it. You have experience with undoing bras, but they've usually been attached to someone else's body.

The only thing left is the lacey purple panties. You try to remove them, but they don't budge. @@.player;"Elvira! I think you forgot to disenchant the panties!"@@
