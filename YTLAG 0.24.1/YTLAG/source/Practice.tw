Luckily, your football uniform is already on<<else>>. If changing in front of your gym class was scary, changing in front of a bunch of muscular dudes is terrifying. Luckily, you don't have to change your boxers. Just to be careful, you change quickly, hoping that no one has the time to see the lack of an outline in your underwear<</if>>.

Your emotions are mixed as you step onto the football field. On one hand, it was the site of some of your proudest moments: that game where you threw for five touchdowns, the last game where you led a come from behind victory against Bear Valley. But it's also bittersweet. It's very unlikely that you can ever match those moments again.

@@.male;"Okay guys, we're going to start with some warmups. And then we're going to do some wind sprints!"@@ He's met with a chorus of groans. @@.male;"No complaining.

@@.thought;What? There wasn't a workout scheduled then! How was I supposed to know he wanted us to do extra?@@<</if>>

The other guys are disappointed, but you're thrilled. You hate wind sprints too, of course. But with all the time it'll take to do warmups and sprints, there will be less time for you to embarrass yourself throwing the football.

It turns out that you're both right and wrong. Right because your speed and athleticism are just as good as they were on friday, and you're one of the faster guys. But you're wrong, because there //is// time for the rest of practice. Who knew that when people ran as fast as they could, it wouldn't take that long?

@@.male;"Okay, good job with the sprints. I'm going to split you into groups. Offensive line and defense, go with Assistant Coach Paulsen.

@@.male;"You, uh, you just stand here until <<print $player.firstname>> needs a break."@@

@@.thought;Shit.@@ You were hoping you wouldn't have to do this. Thirty yards wasn't an easy throw to make even when you had muscles. Helplessly, you watch the other players jog down the field. In a moment, you're going to have to throw the ball to them, and everyone will know.

Coach tosses you the football, and you catch it. @@.thought;Okay, it's a 30 yard throw. I've made it plenty of times before.@@

<<if visited("QB Practice 1 Work")>>You remember your practice with <<print $qb.firstname>>. When you threw the football the way you normally did, it came up short. But when you put extra oomph, it made it there.

@@.thought;If that's what I need for a 10 yard throw, then what do I need to do to throw it 30 yards? Should I just throw it as hard as I can?@@ You decide that you have to do exactly that.

You lock eyes on the first receiver, and release the ball with all your might. The ball floats in the air for way longer than you'd like, but you make it there! The receiver looks surprised, but he catches it easily.

@@.male;"That was an ugly throw, <<print $player.lastname>>."@@ It's all you can do to keep yourself from laughing. Coach is disappointed that you're not throwing like the old <<print $player.firstname>>. But that was the best you could do. You're just happy you didn't totally embarrass yourself.

The rest of the throws go like the first. Usually, when you throw the ball as hard as you can, it travels maybe 60 yards. Now, it's an ugly 30. But you make most of your passes, and coach isn't in a hurry to get <<print $qb.firstname>> involved.<<set $team.respect to $team.respect-5>><<set $player.armStrength to $player.armStrength+6>><<else>>You drop back, and release the football with a perfect throwing motion.

@@.player;"Uh, it slipped."@@

@@.male;"Okay. This throw better be perfect."@@

@@.thought;That's it@@ you think, trying to ignore the raucous laughter of the guys as your second pass falls way too short. @@.thought;I can't throw the ball like I normally would. So I've got to throw harder.@@

Surprisingly, the coach backs off. Your next throws are more on target as you try to calibrate the strength you need to make the football sail 30 yards.

[[Your receivers jog back towards you|Team Practice 1 Routes]]

::Team Practice 1 Routes
A shudder runs through your body as you take the football again. The receiver is supposed to run downfield about thirty yards, and you're supposed to throw the ball to him so he can catch it while he's running.

Hitting a guy standing still is one thing, but you find it incredibly hard to hit a moving target. You knew your old body so well. When you wanted to make a pass, you knew just how hard to throw the ball to get it exactly where you wanted it to go. Now, you have no idea. You know you have to throw the ball harder to get it to the same place, but you don't know how much harder.

The drill goes terribly. Your throws are either too short, or, when you try to overcompensate, too long. Only one of your throws gets caught, and the receiver barely caught it.

It comes as a relief when your coach lets <<print $qb.firstname>> throw the ball. As you stand there idly, you can see him looking at you through the corner of your eye, but you keep your eyes fixed forward. You really don't want to have that conversation right now.

You note with delight that <<print $qb.firstname>> <<if visited("QB Practice 1 Work")>> is just as erratic as you<<else>>while slightly more accurate than you, is struggling<</if>>. And he doesn't have an excuse. @@.thought;Wait. I shouldn't be happy. I need him to lead us to the championship. Unless I can lead us.@@ But you're doubting yourself more and more now.

At long last, the practice is over. The team huddles around, waiting for the coach to say some parting words, but he just turns and storms off the field.

You were hoping that pacing yourself would make the rest of the practice go quicker, but it's the opposite. You're constantly wondering how long it's been, and how many more throws you have to make.

Luckily, all your receivers have noticed that their passes keep being underthrown, and they've creeped up a little bit. Now you have to throw a little under thirty yards, and that makes a big difference. Passes that would have bounced in front of them are now coming in at ankle level. You're sure that everyone is wondering why your passes are so weak, but at least you're not embarrassing yourself.

It's more of the same as what you did, as <<print $qb.firstname>> works on <<if visited("Team Practice 7 Starter DrillFootwork")>>running away from defenders<<elseif visited("Team Practice 7 Starter DrillDistance")>>making long throws<<else>>making short and medium throws<</if>>.

He <<if visited("Team Practice 7 Starter DrillFootwork")>><<if $qb.speed>=25>>does pretty good.

::Team Practice 7 Bench Start
You take a seat by the sideline and watch as <<print $qb.firstname>> and the other starters to practice. As the practice goes on, you take a look at the other benchwarmers. They look checked out, like they've accepted that they're going to be on the bench, and aren't that invested.

@@.thought;I feel the same way. Now that <<print $qb.firstname>> is the starting quarterback, I don't think I have a shot at taking the job back.@@

<<if $qb.speed<25>><<print $qb.firstname>> is trying to throw, but whenever he takes the snap, a linebacker charges at him. Each time that happens, he gets skittish, and either chucks the ball away or stands still while the linebacker tags him.

@@.male;"This isn't working,"@@ Coach says. @@.male;"Receivers, cornerbacks and special teams, go drill with the assistant coach. Everyone else, stay here."

Some of the other players walk off. You, <<print $qb.firstname>>, and most of the team stay where you are.

@@.male;"Okay! <<print $qb.firstname>>, you need to work on not getting sacked. For this drill, you're not going to make any throws. You're just going to try to not get tagged for as long as possible, while the defense tries to get by the lineen and tag you."@@

You groan internally. @@.thought;He's going to have to do a lot of running. Which means I'm going to have to do a lot of running.@@

<<print $qb.firstname>> seems nervous the first time Coach starts the drill, but he quickly gets over it. Soon, he's able to keep his composure as the defense tries to tag him.

@@.male;"Great job, <<print $qb.lastname>>! You look more comfortable already. But it's not enough to just be comfortable. You need to avoid the defense."@@

For the rest of the practice, <<print $qb.firstname>> runs around, trying to evade the defense, as they try to rush by the linemen and tackle him. You think he's improved, but it's hard to tell when he's clearly winded.

@@.male;"Okay, that's enough. Time for the backups!"@@

<<print $qb.firstname>> staggers to the sideline, and you get ready to practice. @@.thought;This is going to be tough. <<print $qb.firstname>> is so tired, and he has more energy than me.@@<<set $qb.speed to $qb.speed+10>><<else>><<print $qb.firstname>> takes the snap and throws a long pass downfield.

@@.male;"Nice job, <<print $qb.lastname>>!"@@ Coach yells.

@@.thought;Wow. I don't think I've seen Coach give praise before.@@

<<print $qb.firstname>> fires off deep pass after deep pass. Some of them aren't caught -- long passes are hard, after all -- but most of them are. By the end of practice, everyone -- you, Coach, the receivers, are all impressed with <<print $qb.firstname>>.

[[Get started|Team Practice 7 Bench Throw]]

::Team Practice 7 Bench Throw
<<getTfProgress voice>><<if $qb.speed<25>>You line up under center, and wait for Coach's whistle. The defense starts charging at the linemen, trying to get by them so they can tag you.

<<if $player.speed>=25>>You stand up straight and scan the field, seeing who's the most likely to chase you. When one of the linebackers breaks free, you're ready, running over to the other side of the field. You're even able to break through the line of scrimmage before getting tagged.

@@.thought;I didn't think I'd do so good!@@

You get ready to run the drill again. This time, two linebackers break free at once, one from each side of the field. You're caught in the middle as they run after you, unable to decide which direction to run in. Finally, you decide to run forward, but it's too late, and you're easily tagged.

@@.male;"That would have been a sack. In that situation, you have to either take off immediately or throw the ball away!"@@

You nod, not looking at Coach. @@.thought;I just made a good play, and now I messed this one up.@@

On the next play, you're charged by two linebackers once again, but this time you're ready for them. You take off up the middle, and you're almost able to get to the line of scrimmage before a defender lays a big hand on your back. @@.male;"Tag!"@@ he shouts happily.

The rest of the practice is tough, but you hold your own. You're feeling more confident about reacting when you're under pressure, but in the back of your mind, you wonder if that's only because you know that you're not playing for real. @@.thought;If this was a game, all these big guys would be trying to tackle me. It's easier to keep my cool when I know that the worst thing that's going to happen is getting tagged.@@

The hardest part about the practice is all the constant running. You started off strong, but by the end, you're gasping for breath. You've been running around for what feels like hours, but when you check your phone, you're surprised to discover that you've been practicing for much shorter than the starters. Luckily, the defense is getting tired as well, which makes it easier to evade them.<<if $player.skillCurse is 0>><<set $player.speed to $player.speed+6>><</if>><<else>>Your eyes nervously dart over the field, trying to see who's about to start running towards you.

One of the linebackers breaks free, and you immediately throw the ball away before he can even take a couple steps.

@@.male;"<<print $player.lastname>>, you need to keep your cool. Getting tackled is part of the game!"@@ Coach yells.

@@.thought;He's right. And I know that I'm not going to get tackled for real. But seeing a big, strong guy running straight at me is scary.@@

You get ready for the next drill, determined not to embarrass yourself again. A linebacker breaks free and starts charging towards you. This time, you <<if $tempTfValue>=2>>squeal<<else>>stifle a squeal<</if>> and start running away. He chases after you, and he's able to catch up to you easily.

The rest of the practice goes similarly: defenders start running towards you, you try your best to run away, but they're always able to catch you before you get far. Worse is when you're charged by two defenders: they come at you from both sides, leaving you without anywhere to run.

Even worse is the constant running. You started off shaky, and it doesn't take long before you're panting for breath. The defense tires too, but not as quickly as you, and they're able to tag you with ease.

It comes as a relief when Coach finally calls the practice to a close. You've been running around for what feels like hours, but when you check your phone, you're surprised to discover that you've been practicing for much shorter than the starters.<<if $player.skillCurse is 0>><<set $player.speed to $player.speed+3>><</if>><</if>><<else>><<if $player.armStrength>=50>>@@.thought;<<print $qb.firstname>> threw long passes. They're going to be expecting me to do the same.@@

You get ready, take a deep breath, and then throw the football as hard as you can. The receiver takes off after it, leaps up, and makes the catch.

@@.thought;I did it!@@

You grab another football, spot your target, and get ready to throw the next pass. It's going to be a mid-length throw, but still much longer than anything could do right after you got transformed. You take another look at your receiver, and then throw the football at him. It sails through the air into his hands.

@@.thought;I'm on a roll!@@

Unfortunately, Coach whistles the practice to a halt before you're able to make another throw. @@.thought;That's not fair. How come the backups don't get to practice as much?@@<<if $player.skillCurse is 0>><<set $player.armStrength to $player.armStrength+3>><</if>><<else>>@@.thought;<<print $qb.firstname>> threw long passes. I don't have as strong of an arm. Should I throw short passes?@@

@@.male;"Okay, <<print $player.lastname>>, throw some long passes, just like <<print $qb.firstname>>."@@

@@.thought;That settles that@@ you think miserably.

You spot a receiver deep down the field, and throw the football as hard as you can towards him. <<if $player.armStrength>=30>>As you watch the ball spiral through the air, you think you've done it, but it falls well short of the receiver.<<else>>It doesn't even make it halfway.

@@.male;"<<print $player.lastname>>, you're working on deep throws, remember!"@@

@@.thought;I know!@@ you think, frustrated.<</if>>

Your next pass is towards a receiver who's standing closer to you than the last one. It's a mid-length throw, but it's still a respectable one. If you make it, that is.

You don't. The receiver lunges forward, but isn't able to make the catch.

@@.thought;Okay. I'm going to make the next pass.@@

Unfortunately, Coach chooses that moment to whistle practice to a close. @@.thought;I only tried two passes!

You sigh. You're going to have to get it out of the way sooner or later. <<if $playerStarter>>@@.thought;What are they going to think when I suddenly can't throw a football?@@<<else>>@@.thought;Maybe they're so used to me being bad that they won't notice I've gotten even worse?@@<</if>>

You stare at the first receiver, release the football in a perfect motion, and pray.

You used to be able to get the football about halfway there. This time, it leaves your hand with a whimper, and falls straight to the ground. It went maybe a couple yards at the most.

Immediately, you turn away from your receivers, but it doesn't help much. You can still hear their laughter.

<</if>>You sigh. You don't have a choice. You know from experience with Coach that when he decides on something, there's no changing his mind.

You grit your teeth, take a step back, and throw the football as hard as you can.

<<if visited("Team Practice KickedOff Throw Alone")>>The pass goes slightly further than last time, but not by much.<<else>>Your throws used to make it halfway to your receivers.

He turns and addresses the receivers. @@.male;"And his last throw was like this?"@@

They look uncomfortable. Despite them laughing at you, they clearly don't want to rat you out.

Your teammates avoid looking at you. Not that you'd want to meet their gaze anyway. @@.thought;It's so embarrassing. Football was who I am. And now I'm not even on the team anymore. What am I?@@

You think about Coach's words: you shouldn't come back until you can throw a football properly. @@.thought;He obviously thinks I can do that, but it's not going to happen. I gave up my ability to play football...permanently. I guess I'm off the team for good now.@@

You want to break down and cry, but you're still within sight of your teammates. @@.thought;I can't believe none of them stuck up for me. I guess I don't have much in common with them anymore, but still. We're supposed to have each other's backs.@@

You continue stewing until you reach the boys locker room. There, you sit on the bench, alone.

@@.thought;This is the last time I'll be here as part of the football team.@@

You stomp your foot in frustration. You've been feeling pretty emotional lately, and getting kicked off the team is bringing everything to the surface once again. @@.thought;It's all my fault! I should never have listened to <<print $witch.firstname>> when she started talking about a spell.@@

::Team Practice KickedOff Shower
You strip off your clothes, grab a towel, and head to the showers. The one benefit to being alone in the locker room is that you can change freely without worrying about anyone seeing you.

The hot water of the shower feels nice, and for a moment, you forget all about the team or the curse. Time passes, but you're not aware of it.

All of a sudden, you hear someone moving around inside the locker room.

You shut off the water, and suddenly feel cold. @@.player;"Who's there?"@@ you call, painfully aware of the fact that, whoever it is, you'd be powerless to stop them with your weak, girly body.
