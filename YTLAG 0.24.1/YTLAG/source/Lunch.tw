The old you would have yelled at her for implying that you're not completely manly, but it doesn't sound like she was putting you down for that. If anything, she was putting you down for not being girly enough. That thought makes you confused.

@@.player;"Uh, what do I need to improve on?"@@ you finally ask.<<else>>@@.witch;"If I can give you some advice, <<print $qb.firstname>> is straight, so he only goes for girls. Which means you don't have a chance."@@

You smile at that reminder that you're a man. @@.thought;If she's right, and she's his sister so she probably is...that means I don't have a chance with <<print $qb.firstname>> unless I act girlier. But is it worth it? I don't want to be a girl!@@<</if>>

The bell rings, interrupting you.

::Lunch Friends Morgan
You sit down with your friends, who are in the middle of a conversation. You try to listen, but your heart isn't in it. You don't feel popular anymore, and you're pretty sure that you're only still at this table because nobody has had the heart to ask you to leave.

@@.female;"David still hasn't asked you out yet?"@@ a girl asks.

@@.female;"No,"@@ her friend sighs. @@.female;"I don't know what I need to do. I flirt with him, I hint that I like him, and nothing happens! I don't even know if he likes me!"@@

You turn your head towards them, now paying attention to their conversation. @@.thought;What //are// you supposed to do if you like a guy but don't know if he likes you?@@

@@.female;"Of course he likes you! You're pretty, and a cheerleader. He probably just doesn't know that you like him."@@

@@.female;"Guys are so dumb sometimes."@@

@@.female;"You're telling me. Listen, here's what you need to do."@@

You lean forward.

@@.female;"You need to...oh, @@<<if $player.feminine>=18>>@@.female;that sissy@@<<elseif $player.feminine>=10>>@@.female;that girly boy@@<<else>>@@.female;<<print $player.firstname>>@@<</if>> @@.female;is watching us."@@

You quickly look away as the girls break into laughter.

@@.female;"What's the matter? Want to get advice?"@@

@@.player;"I've got to, uh, go to the bathroom,"@@ you say quickly, standing up.

<<set $player.crush to $qb.firstname>>

::Lunch Friends Morgan Overhear
You walk out of the lunchroom quickly without looking back. You don't want to know if anyone is laughing or even looking at you. When you turn the corner, you slump against the wall and catch your breath.

@@.thought;I'm just overreacting. They'll have forgotten all about it by the time I go back.@@

You wait a little longer, and then walk back into the lunchroom, trying to act like nothing happened.

The two girls are still at your table, and they're talking to a third girl who you can't see. Slowly, you approach the table. @@.thought;I wonder what they're talking about. Are they talking about me?@@

@@.female;"That's so exciting! He's so cute!"@@ one of the girls says to the third girl.

@@.female;"Yeah! And I think he's going to ask me out!"@@ she giggles.

@@.female;"Then you'll be dating @@<<if $playerStarter>>@@.female;a @@<<else>>@@.female;the star@@<</if>> @@.female;quarterback!"@@

Suddenly, you realize who the third girl is. She's Morgan.

@@.female;"What about <<print $player.firstname>>? You know he likes <<print $qb.firstname>> too, right?"@@

@@.thought;How does everyone know about that already?@@

@@.female;"Yeah, but I'm not worried about <<print $player.firstname>>,"@@ she says, flipping her hair. @@.female;"Obviously, <<print $qb.firstname>> is going to go for a real girl."@@

Just then, the bell rings, and you scurry out of the lunchroom before either of them can realize that you were listening in again.

<<if $player.masculinity<=0>>@@.thought;A real girl? I have a pussy, just like her. But...I know what she means. What if she's right?@@<<elseif $player.masculinity<50>>@@.thought;A real girl? Well, I don't feel like a guy, but I don't really feel like a guy either. What am I?@@<<else>>@@.thought;What did she mean by that comment about a real girl? I'm still a guy, even if I have a pussy. Right?@@<</if>>
