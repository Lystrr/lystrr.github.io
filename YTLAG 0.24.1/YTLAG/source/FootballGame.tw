You line up behind center. Your teammates line up in front of you and to your sides. The eleven Spring Gardens defenders crouch in front of them. The noise from the crowd is almost deafening. Everything feels familiar, but it also feels alien.

You drop back, and scan the field. Ryan's covered, another receiver is open, but he's too far away. Maybe if you threw it really hard? No, that wouldn't work...

BAM!

You're flat on your back, a Spring Gardens linebacker on top of you. Somehow, miracuously, you manage to hang onto the football.

You drop back, and spot the tight end open several yards in front of you. Out of the corner of your eye, you also see a Spring Gardens linebacker beat his man and start running straight towards you.

Without thinking, you blindly toss the football in the tight end's direction.

The good news is that you got rid of the football and didn't take a sack. The bad news is that now you're flat on your back, with the linebacker on top of you. The other bad news is that the tight end dropped the football. Or maybe you didn't make a good throw?

As soon as the ball's snapped, you hand the ball off to Everett, your running back.

And not a moment too soon. Seconds after you give Everett the football, you get knocked onto your back by a Spring Gardens linebacker.

You can hear the referee shouting something about a late hit, and a penalty being called on Spring Gardens, but it's hard to tell what's happening when there's another man on top of you.<</if>>

The linebacker takes his time getting up. He's not that much bigger than you are, but it feels like you got flattened by a truck. Impatiently, you wiggle to try to get free. In spite of yourself, you're getting a little turned on. This guy who's so much stronger than you is on top of you, and you're helpless beneath him.

Finally, the linebacker gets off and you snap out of it. @@.thought;What came over me?@@

<<if $drive1Result is "run">>The Stallions made some good progress thanks to the penalty. You feel even less comfortable throwing, though, and you keep handing off to Everett.

Feeling slightly more confident, you take the field and get into position. Surprisingly, the drive starts off well. The defense expects you to hand off to Everett, and you're able to take advantage of that and make several quick, short throws. <<print $witch.firstname>> may have taken away your strength, but you still have an intuitive understanding of football.

Your next two throws fall harmlessly to the ground. This next play has to be a success, or you'll be forced to punt.

The ball is snapped, and you drop back to pass. Out of the corner of your eye, you see two Spring Gardens defenders beat their man and start sprinting towards you. You're going to have to run for it.

You do, looking in vain for someone to pass to. Nobody is open. Wait! Ryan is open. But he's far away, and running further downfield. He's about 30 yards away from you now. It's not that bad, and you could have made it, if you still had your strength. You don't have your strength, obviously, but if you somehow made the throw, it would be a sure touchdown.

Speaking of those guys, they're gaining on you. You're going to have to commit to the run. If you're fast enough, maybe you can keep the drive alive.

<<if $player.speed>=15>><<set $stallionsscore to $stallionsscore+7>>Luckily, you've been running on the treadmill, and you're still in shape. The Spring Gardens defenders are big, but they're not fast, and you're able to get the first down.

The game is almost over. This will probably be your last chance to score, and after that, Spring Gardens will get one last chance. Hopefully, you can make the most out of this drive.

This drive starts off pretty well, too. You're making good progress down the field. For a moment, you're feeling extremely happy: you're leading your team to another scoring opportunity, and making passes in spite of everything that's happened. Then you remember that the defense you're facing is supposed to suck. @@.thought;It still counts. My receivers are catching my passes. It's not just because the defense sucks.@@

Everett pulls off some solid runs, and you make a couple of short passes. You're only one throw away from getting a touchdown.

You get ready to pass and try to find an open receiver. It's tough. Everyone is covered well. Maybe if you threw the football high enough, Ryan Callahan, your 6 foot 5 wide receiver could jump up and catch it. But it's a tough throw and could go wrong.

You and the Stallions run out onto the field. Unlike the crowd at Pinewood Prep, the crowd here is subdued. @@.thought;Upper Lake has been bad for years. I guess they don't really care about football.@@

You line up behind the center and immediately feel a surge of panic. This all seems to be happening too fast. You're not ready to play this game. Upper Lake isn't a good team by any stretch, but they're better than Spring Gardens, and <<if $team.wins is 2>>you barely beat them<<else>>you lost to them<</if>>. You're going to get exposed. You're going to...

The ball is snapped.

You snap back to reality and somehow catch the snap. Your eyes scan for your receivers. Ryan Callahan is streaking downfield, tightly covered by an Upper Lake defensive back. If you made the throw, it would probably be a big play, but it's risky.

You also see another receiver who is pretty much wide open, though he's also much closer to you.

<<if $playerStarter>>Without thinking, you step up and throw the football deep in the direction of Ryan Callahan. He's already pretty far away from you, and he'll be even further away by the time the football catches up with him, so you had to put your all into that throw.

The rest of the drive is pretty easy. You're already close to the end zone, and you're able to make a couple quick passes, and Everett runs it in for the touchdown.

You run out onto the field again, and prepare to take the snap. Southview's defense isn't as good as its offense, but it's still pretty strong, and it scares you.

The ball is snapped, and you scan the field. Ryan Callahan is streaking down the field, turns, and gets open. You could make a big gain on this play, but you'd have to throw the ball far.

Another receiver has also gotten open closer to you. But as you turn in his direction, the defender adjusts. You'd have to throw the ball in a tight window if you wanted to make the throw.

Maybe you're right about being better once you get over your nerves, but that moment never comes. Every time the ball is snapped, you look around nervously, worried about big, strong Southview linebackers barreling into you. If one of them took you down the way they took down <<print $qb.firstname>>, you don't know if you could get off the field.

You take a couple painful sacks, but nothing that causes an injury. The rest of your passes are either interceptions or come nowhere close to their target.

Finally, Coach pulls you out of the game. You trot back to the sidelines, eager to be out of view.

As you pass the guy who's coming in to replace you, you do a double take. @@.player;"You're a running back,"@@ you tell him.

He shrugs. @@.male;"I played quarterback in junior high."@@

@@.thought;So now I'm the backup to the backup.@@

He doesn't do much better than you, though he at least looks a little less panicked. Ever since <<print $qb.firstname>> left the game, the Stallions haven't scored a single point.<</if>>

Fortunately, the Southview offense is struggling. They're unable to score during the third quarter, and they go scoreless for the most of the fourth quarter as well.

There isn't a lot of time left in the game now, and Southview has the ball. To your disappointment, they're making quick progress down the field.

<<print $qb.firstname>> takes the snap and scans the field, looking for someone to throw to. There isn't anyone: all of his receivers are covered. Well, almost covered. There's one receiver who keeps trying to slip away from his defender. <<print $qb.firstname>> could throw to him, but it would be risky. If he isn't able to put it in the right place, it could be an interception.

You take a deep breath and then throw the ball at the receiver. He's not that far away, and your throw <<if $player.armStrength>=50>>easily <</if>>covers the distance. The real test is how accurate you were.
