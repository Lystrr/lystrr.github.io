[[I am at least 18 years old|Start]]

::Start
@@.male;"You ready for the game, man?"@@ Patrick asks as you step into the dorm room.

@@.player;"Are you kidding?"@@ you grin, rubbing your wet hair with a towel. @@.player;"Bear Valley doesn't stand a chance."@@

It's the morning before the homecoming football game. Next to you, your roommates Patrick and Marco are putting on their school uniforms and getting ready for the day. You're not thrilled about the uniforms: the suit and tie are stuffy and uncomfortable. But it's not all bad. The girls look pretty cute in their skirts.

You drop your towel to the ground and start looking for your boxers. Why does your side of the room have to be such a mess?

@@.male;"Dude!"@@ says Marco. @@.male;"Why are you showing us your dick?"@@

@@.player;"Why are you looking?"@@ you reply. Truthfully though, you like showing it off. It's an absolute monster, and you've never lacked for female attention. Even flaccid, it's about five inches. Erect, it's much longer.

@@.male;"Are you going to stand there with your cock out or are you going to get dressed?"@@ Patrick snaps.

@@.thought;That's right. I should @@[[get dressed|Get Dressed Intro]]

::Get Dressed Intro
<<set $expectedOutfit to "school">><<set $changeEndPassage to "Wear Intro">><<set $outfit to "school">><<display Clothes>>

::Wear Intro
With a heavy sigh, you pull on your dress shirt and jacket, pull up your dress pants and tie your tie. You think you're ready for the day, but you feel you need to check the mirror to be sure. Either that or you liked looking at yourself.

While your roommates file out to get to first period, you hurry to the floor bathroom. Standing at the sink, you look into the mirror, and size yourself up:

Your name is <<textbox "$player.firstname" "Corey" autofocus>> <<textbox "$player.lastname" "Redmond">>, and you're the most popular guy in school. You're six feet tall, with rippling muscles, close cropped blond hair, a handsome face, and a killer right arm. In your junior year, you led the Pinewood Prep Stallions to the state playoffs. Now that you're a senior, you're thinking you can win the whole thing.

You're dating the hottest girl in school, <<textbox "$girlfriend.firstname" "Jessica">> <<textbox "$girlfriend.lastname" "Carlson">>, and it's all but official that the two of you are going to be homecoming king and queen.

The bell rings, and you turn away from the mirror, ready to slog through [[class|Math]] so you can get to the game and the homecoming dance. Life is good. Little do you know that this is going to be the worst day of your life.

::Math
Leisurely, you stroll into the classroom ten seconds after the last bell rings. The math teacher, Mrs. Reed, glares at you but says nothing.

@@.female;"Okay class. Time for our quiz."@@ There are a few groans. @@.female;"No complaining. You knew it was coming."@@

You take a thick packet and stare blankly at it. You have only the vaguest idea of what the questions are even asking. Maybe you should have studied, but you were too preoccupied with the game and with your campaign to be Homecoming King.

You look at the clock. @@.thought;49 minutes to go. How am I going to get through this quiz?@@

It seems like you only have three options.

[[Answer Randomly]]

<<set $player.relationship to $girlfriend.firstname>>

::Try Your Best
You're not very good at math, and this test doesn't even really matter anyway. You've noticed scouts showing up at your games, and you're pretty sure you're going to get a scholarship offer. But you're a competitive guy, and you're not going to just give up.

You stare at the thick packet. @@.thought;Okay, here's a triangle. And these numbers by the triangles are angles. Okay, so we're doing trig after all.@@

You're proud of yourself for a moment, until you realize that the top of the test says ''MATH 300 TEST 1 - TRIGONOMETRY''

Sheepishly, you look at the first question: ''1) What is the sine of angle x?''

Now that you know what the test is on, you rack your brains trying to recall everything you remember Mrs. Reed said about trig. It's hard -- when you did make it to class, you spent most of your time goofing off and talking to your friends.

Finally, you remember something. To get the sine of the angle, you were supposed to divide one of the sides of the triangle by another side, but you can't remember which ones.

Skipping that question, you look at the next one. That one asks you to find the cosine. And so does the next.

Frustrated, you look up at the rest of the class. Somehow, 20 minutes have already passed. Everyone else is diligently working. That nerd Norm Frederickson is already done. You sigh and turn back to the packet. @@.thought;I'd better just make my best guess. I don't have a lot of time.@@

You try your best to remember what Mrs. Reed taught you, but a lot of it is just guesswork. Mercifully, you finish and hand your test in.

@@.thought;That could have gone so much better. But I don't think I failed.@@ You try to put trig out of your mind as you head to your next class. You don't like to try something if you're not going to be the best at it, and you feel pretty stupid right now. But at least you didn't give up.

@@.thought;It's multiple choice at least.@@ Quickly, you fill out C for every answer and get up to hand in your test. Looking around, you note that you're the first one done. Even the nerd, Norm Frederickson is still working.

@@.female;"Done already, <<print $player.firstname>>?"@@ Mrs. Reed asks. Then she looks at your answer sheet. @@.female;"Oh."@@ You look at her, expecting her to say something, but another kid has asked her a question. You take advantage of the moment to leave.

You sigh. You're going to bomb this test. Not that it //really// matters. You've noticed scouts showing up at your games, and you're pretty sure you're going to get a scholarship offer. But you've got an hour to kill, and you're a competitive guy. It bothers you to be bad at something.

To your right, the class nerd, Norm Frederickson is scribbling furiously. You look up at Mrs. Reed. She's distracted by another student and isn't paying any attention to you.

You let your eyes move over to the right. The desks are pretty close together, and it's easy to glance at Norm's paper. You start copying down his answers. D, B, B, C, A...

Suddenly, he looks straight at you. You freeze, waiting for him to call Mrs. Reed, but he just glares at you and turns back to his sheet. @@.thought;Interesting. He didn't even move it. So I can keep copying from him?@@

Soon, Norm is done. You make a few deliberate errors so your answer sheet doesn't look exactly like Norm's, wait an appropriate amount of time, and turn your test in. You've gotten pretty good at cheating, and you know what you have to do so you don't get caught.

@@.thought;I did good. Either a B or A.@@ You feel a little guilty, but you try to shake it off. @@.thought;If he didn't want me to copy off him, he could have moved his paper.@@

You and your current girlfriend, <<print $girlfriend.firstname>> <<print $girlfriend.lastname>> are running for homecoming king and queen. They're going to announce it at the end of the day, but it's all but official that you won.

The last class before lunch is history. Your teacher is droning on and on, and the classroom is hot and humid. You look at the clock. Still 45 minutes left.

@@.thought;The only good part is that I'm sitting right behind @@<<textbox "$witch.firstname" "Raven" autofocus>> <<textbox "$witch.lastname" "Coventry">>@@.thought;.@@ You're not usually into goth girls, but her bra strap is peeking out of her thin shirt, and she looks pretty hot.

You're dating <<print $girlfriend.firstname>>, of course, but there's nothing wrong with looking at the menu every once in a while.

As you're looking at the goth girl again, your phone loudly goes off. Then it goes off again. She turns to look at you, and you try to play it off like you were looking at the teacher.

@@.thought;I hope she didn't catch me staring at her. She's crazy.@@ You mean that literally. She's the president of the Witchcraft Club. Everyone knows it's nonsense, but that doesn't seem to bother her.

@@.female;Do you guys want to go to Archie's for lunch?@@
@@.male;Sounds fun@@

@@.female;On my way@@

@@.thought;Fuck. My friends went to Archie's without me, and I'm stuck in this cafeteria.@@

You send off a quick text, letting them know that you can't make it, and then turn your attention to the lunch room. You spot lots of familiar faces, and you know that everyone would be happy for you to sit with them.

Patrick catches your eyes. He's sitting with Marco, and a couple other teammates. With a game coming up, it would be natural for you to [[sit with the rest of the football team.|Lunch With Team]] But you also spot <<print $witch.firstname>> and her brother <<textbox "$qb.firstname" "Griffin" autofocus>> sitting by themselves. @@.thought;Maybe I should@@ [[sit with them|Lunch with Witch]] @@.thought;and apologize?@@

@@.male;"It was late at night, and we were drinking. And, I don't know, man, it just seemed like the right time. But I drank so much that the next day, I forgot I had asked her, so I asked her to homecoming again."@@ The three of you break out into raucous laughter.

You file into the gymnasium, and head towards the boys locker room. Gym's your favorite class, but you're looking forward to this unit more than most. Coach has just started the swimming unit. You're a natural in the pool, and it lets you show off your muscular body. Some of the girls look pretty hot in their swimsuits too. Especially <<print $girlfriend.firstname>>.

The other guys are in various states of undress, as they quickly change into their swim trunks. Some of the less confident guys go to the stalls to change.

You take your time. You're proud of your body, and the heat flowing into the locker room feels nice.

Finally, you finish changing, and head to the pool with the rest of the boys. <<print $girlfriend.firstname>> is waiting for you as you step out.

@@.girlfriend;"I didn't know you'd look so hot in just your swim trunks,"@@ she says, touching your chest.

@@.player;"You're looking pretty hot too,"@@ you flirt back. It's true. She's wearing a small blue bikini that shows off her long, smooth legs, and her flat stomach.

@@.male;"Okay! Stop flirting! Boys to the boys side, girls to the girls side!"@@ your coach yells.

Reluctantly, you step away from <<print $girlfriend.firstname>> and sit with the other guys. Across the pool, the girls sit together, all wearing bikinis, and showing a lot of skin.

@@.male;"Okay,"@@ the coach begins once everyone is seated, going into his customary lecture. @@.male;"We're going to start something new. We're going to be diving."@@ There's an equal mixture of cheers and groans. @@.male;"Now, I know that some of you are better swimmers than others, so it's okay if you don't want to dive. You can stay in the shallow end. But what I'm grading on is effort. If you're going to dive, you better commit to it. And if you're in the shallow end, don't think it means that you can slack off."@@

You line up with the divers. Even though you're a strong swimmer, you're not very confident about diving. But you're not going to go to the shallow end like a pussy. You look over and note that some of the guys and most of the girls are over there.

<<print $girlfriend.firstname>> is first, and she executes a perfect swan dive into the pool. She's got a tight, athletic body, and is on both the swim team and the cheerleaders.

The other kids in front of you take their turns diving with less success. Finally, it's your turn. You step onto the diving board and stare down. It's a good drop into the pool.

You and the Stallions run out onto the field to the beat of some dance music. You can feel the energy of the crowd and you're pumped...only to immediately head to the bench. The Bears will get the football first.

As you wait, you scan the crowd. The stands are packed. All of Pinewood Prep must be at the game. On the sidelines, you can see the cheerleaders. You spot <<print $girlfriend.firstname>> and she gives you a little wave. You wave back and continue scanning the crowd. You see <<print $witch.firstname>> watching intently. @@.thought;Weird, I didn't think she was into football. I guess her brother is on the team.@@

Luckily, the Bears backup quarterback is struggling, and the Stallions defense easily stops them. You jog out onto the field, feeling all eyes upon you. You're the starting quarterback and the star of the team, and you're ready to destroy the Bears.

You fire off a couple quick passes, and Everett Smith, the running back, breaks off a couple nice runs. Before you know it, you're in scoring position. You get ready to pass, and see a couple options.

Everett is open. You can throw a safe pass to him. It wouldn't get a touchdown, but you would keep moving.

Ryan Callahan, a 6 foot 5 wide receiver is being covered by a defender. It would be a tougher throw, but if you made it, it would be a touchdown. And he's a big guy, so he //should// be able to jump higher and catch the ball.

You're doing a good job so far. You don't want to take a big risk and lose all the progress that you've made. Besides, Smith is open. You throw a quick, short pass to him. He catches it and runs for a little bit before getting tackled.

Unfortunately, the rest of your throws don't go as well. You're still doing pretty good, but coach is forced to settle for the field goal instead of going for the touchdown.

@@.thought;I could have gotten a touchdown. Oh well. At least we scored.@@

You head to the bench and watch the Stallions defense take over, waiting for your next chance to play. You don't have to wait that long. The Bears backup quarterback is pretty bad, and your defense easily stops him.

You set your eyes on Callahan, and loft the ball at him. It's a perfect spiral. He leaps up at the same time as the defender...and comes down with the football. Touchdown!

You're not able to keep the smile from your face as you jog back to the sideline. The crowd is going wild, and the cheerleaders are in the middle of a dance. Once you're back with your team, you get a round of pats on your back. @@.thought;I did it. I knew I could get a touchdown, and I did.@@

The Stallions defense comes onto the field now, letting you get a little bit of rest. But the rest doesn't last long. The Bears offense gets stopped easily. Their backup quarterback must be pretty bad.

<<print $qb.firstname>> looks at you in surprise. He must have thought you'd be pissed off that you're being benched. And you are. But it's not his fault.

With a groan, you hoist <<print $witch.firstname>>'s unconscious body over your shoulders and hobble towards the exit. In her spell, she mentioned taking your strength, but you're able to handle her just fine. @@.thought;Of course she coudln't sap my strength. I can't believe I was worried.@@

Reaching the exit to the locker room, you gently lean her against the wall, while you fish your phone out of your pocket. You scroll down until you get to <<print $qb.firstname>>'s number. There aren't a lot of messages between the two of you, just him telling you @@.qb;This is <<print $qb.firstname>>@@ and you saying @@.player;Ok@@.

You quickly send a text to him: @@.player;Hey, your sister passed out in the locker room. What should I do?@@

He responds almost immediately. @@.qb;I'll be right over@@

With nothing to do, you lean back against the wall and play with your phone, waiting for him to show up.

Eventually, he does. @@.qb;"Sorry I'm late,"@@ he says, sounding a little out of breath. He puts an arm around his sister, and the two of you start to walk her back to her dorm.

@@.qb;"I went to the girls locker room first,"@@ <<print $qb.firstname>> continues.

@@.player;"You went to the girls locker room?"@@ you ask, surprised.

@@.qb;"Hell yeah. She's my sister. And it's so late. No one was there."@@

@@.player;"Okay, fair enough."@@ The two of you succeed in marching <<print $witch.firstname>> out of the gym and begin helping her across campus.

@@.qb;"So why was she in the boys locker room anyway? And why did she pass out?"@@

You look at him. He looks back intently. He knows her better than anyone, and if you told him what happened, maybe he could help you if she really was a witch. @@.thought;Wait, what am I saying? Of course she's not a witch! He would just laugh at me.@@

@@.qb;"Oh. Do you think someone might have, you know?"@@

@@.player;"Taken advantage of her?"@@ He nods. @@.player;"No. Nobody on the football team would do that."@@

@@.qb;"Okay,"@@ <<print $qb.firstname>> says, looking relieved. @@.qb;"Then why would...oh no."@@

@@.player;"What?"@@ you ask, curious. <<print $qb.firstname>> looks pretty scared.

@@.qb;"Don't worry about it, <<print $player.firstname>>,"@@ he tells you. @@.qb;"I can take her the rest of the way."@@

@@.player;"Uh, okay,"@@ you say. <<print $qb.firstname>> and <<print $witch.firstname>> disappear around a corner, leaving you alone in the girls dorm.

@@.thought;Well, that was weird@@ you think as you walk back to your dorm. @@.thought;What spooked him? Could it have been...no, that's ridiculous.@@

[[Go to sleep]]

::Tell the truth
@@.player;"Yeah, I was with her when it happened. But you're not going to believe me."@@

You look at <<print $qb.firstname>> to see his reaction, but he's silent.

@@.player;"So I've just gotten out of the shower and she's waiting for me in the locker room. And then we, uh, had an argument."@@

A group of girls walk by, giggling. You stop and let them pass. Telling <<print $qb.firstname>> is one thing, but you don't want the whole school to know. @@.player;"I tried to leave but she started chanting. It sounded kind of like a spell."@@

You look at <<print $qb.firstname>>, waiting for him to laugh at you, but his reaction is even worse. His face has gone white, and he's stopped helping you carry <<print $witch.firstname>>.

@@.player;"What? Are you saying she did a real spell?"@@

@@.qb;"Let's talk when we get to her room,"@@ he says. It's your turn to look scared. But you're not getting any answers yet, so the two of you carry <<print $witch.firstname>> the rest of the way.

@@.player;"Okay,"@@ you say, shutting the door as <<print $qb.firstname>> helps her into bed. @@.player;"What's going on?"@@

<<print $qb.firstname>> nods.

You lean back and sigh. @@.player;"Are you fucking with me? If you're fucking with me, I'll beat your ass."@@

@@.qb;"N...no, <<print $player.firstname>>, I'm not fucking with you."@@

@@.player;"So you're saying she cursed me?"@@ you shout, your voice rising an octave.

@@.qb;"What did she say, exactly?"@@ <<print $qb.firstname>> asks, leaning forward.

@@.player;"She wanted to take away my strength. And something about a bull."@@

@@.qb;"You carried <<print $witch.firstname>> here,"@@ <<print $qb.firstname>> offers. @@.qb;"You're still strong."@@

@@.player;"That's right! It didn't work!"@@ you say, beaming. <<print $qb.firstname>> smiles. @@.player;"Wait,"@@ you say, as a horrible thought occurs to you. @@.player;"She said it started at dawn."@@

@@.qb;"Well, that's okay!"@@ <<print $qb.firstname>> says, giving a slightly weaker smile. @@.qb;"By morning, you'll know if it worked or not."@@

You groan.

@@.qb;"But not always!"@@ he says quickly. @@.qb;"Her spells have some side effects."@@

@@.player;"Side effects?"@@

@@.qb;"Yeah. Once, we were at her birthday party, and I wanted the last slice of cake. She wanted it too, so I tried to eat it really fast. She cast a spell, but she said //Keep your mouth shut//. I couldn't talk for a week."@@
