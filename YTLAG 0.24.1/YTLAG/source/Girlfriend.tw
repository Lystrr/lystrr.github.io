<<print $girlfriend.firstname>> gives you a bullshit-piercing glare. @@.girlfriend;"I know you, <<print $player.firstname>>. You're always in the mood for sex. Don't give me that crap."@@

You're both silent for a moment. @@.girlfriend;"I don't know what's going on, but I don't think you're into me. So, uh, should we break up?"@@

You look at her in disbelief. She's your girlfriend! You can't break up! Her problems seem petty and insignificant compared to your own. She's upset that her boyfriend hasn't fucked her in a couple days? You just lost your dick! If only she knew what you were going through, she wouldn't complain...

That thought makes you pause. @@.thought;If she knew what I was going through. Well, I could...tell her?@@ Your heartbeat speeds up. That thought seems crazy. You can't tell anyone that you have a pussy! You would be the laughingstock of the school. But she is your girlfriend, and you're pretty sure she wouldn't tell anyone.

<<else>>@@.girlfriend;"Yeah! It's just...I'm really fucking horny right now."@@

You're really horny too, and you would love nothing more than to pound her pussy right now. A sigh escapes your lips. Sex isn't possible right now. At least...no, you don't even want to think about that.

@@.player;"Uh, I don't really feel like it tonight,"@@ you say, realizing that she's still waiting for an answer.

@@.girlfriend;"Fine,"@@ <<print $girlfriend.firstname>> says, clearly unhappy. @@.girlfriend;"Maybe tomorrow night?"@@

You know very well that sex isn't going to be possible tomorrow night either. It feels pretty cruel to lead her on. @@.thought;Eventually, she's going to be fed up.@@ You don't know what to do about it though. Maybe you could tell her your secret.

She snorts. @@.girlfriend;"Try me."@@

So you do. You start from the beginning, telling her how <<print $witch.firstname>> cursed you. You were supposed to just lose your muscles, but you seem to be changing even more, including losing your dick.

@@.girlfriend;"Did you say you lost your dick?"@@

@@.player;"Uh, yeah. I've got a pussy now,"@@ you say matter-of-factly.

You look at her anxiously, trying to judge her response. Is she going to be sympathetic? Understanding? Grateful to you for sharing something so embarrassing?

Instead, she laughs. @@.girlfriend;"You expect me to believe that? Please. I guess your muscles are harder to see now, but no. That's ridiculous. <<print $witch.firstname>> and those witches are crazy, but they're not //real// witches."@@

You grimace. You just opened up and told her your most embarrassing secret, and she laughed at you. @@.thought;I guess I can't blame her. I didn't believe witchcraft was real either.@@

@@.girlfriend;"I'll ask again. Should we break up?"@@

Your explanation obviously isn't going to be enough. If you want her to believe you, you'll have to show her proof. But what proof? It was already embarrassing enough telling her all this. Now you're supposed to show her?

You don't have a choice. If you want <<print $girlfriend.firstname>> to believe you, you'll have to show her your pussy, and you can't lose her.

Quickly, you cross the room and lock the door. Showing your girlfriend is one thing, but you're not going to take any chances with your roommates walking in and seeing your vagina. <<print $girlfriend.firstname>> looks confused. @@.thought;Did she think I wasn't being serious?@@

@@.girlfriend;"Yeah, sorry. Look, would you believe it if someone said this happened to him?"@@

@@.player;"Probably not,"@@ you admit. @@.thought;Damn!@@<</if>>

It's best to just rip off the band-aid.

But what if there's someone in the bathroom?@@ You look down at yourself. At least your towel is wrapped around your chest like a girl. If there is a girl in there, and you can get to the shower quickly, she won't notice anything.

You take a deep breath, and then enter the bathroom.

You can't see anything except for a pair of feet inside a stall. @@.thought;Okay, good.@@ You quickly cross over to the shower before the girl can leave the stall and step inside. Stripping off your bikini and hanging it up, you step inside.

You let the water run for a couple minutes and wash yourself. You already took a shower this morning, but you know that as soon as you finish your shower, you'll have to get started shaving yourself.

Finally, you finish your shower, and you can't delay it anymore. You turn off the water.

@@.thought;I can't believe I'm about to do this@@ you think as you open the shaving cream. You squirt some onto your hand and lather up your leg. You do the same thing for the other leg and your arms. You feel a little silly standing there naked covered with shaving cream, and you grab your razor.

You've used razors before to shave your beard, back when you still had one. But this razor is much different. For starters, it's a colorful pink instead of a boring shade of black. It also feels different, lighter in your hand.

With a trembling hand, you raise your right leg and put the razor flat against your skin. You run the razor slowly over your leg, and some hair falls out onto the shower floor. You do it again, and more hair falls out.

You continue shaving your leg. You've gotten the hang of it now, and it feels strangely pleasant. You'd never admit it to anyone, but you get a sense of satisfaction as you shave. When you first got in the shower, your leg was <<if $player.legs is 3>>kind of <</if>>hairy. But now, it's changing slowly in front of your eyes. With each stroke, more and more hair disappears, and your leg looks more and more smooth. You do the same for your other leg and your arms.

When you're finally finished, you look down at the result.

When you're satisfied that your leg is smooth, you do the same thing for your leg and your arms.

Finally, you take a step back and admire the result.

@@.female;"Great!"@@ the blonde says. @@.female;"I'm Ashley, by the way."@@

You follow <<print $girlfriend.firstname>> and Ashley over to where a group of guys and girls are setting up a volleyball net. You can't help but feel intimidated. The guys are all large and muscular, and the girls look as athletic as Ashley. One of the guys looks at you, and you take a step back, aware of how little clothing you have on.

@@.thought;The bikini just draws their attention to my boobs and pussy. He's so lucky, being able to walk around in big shorts and no shirt. If I wasn't wearing this top, everyone would be staring at my boobs.@@

The girls start to walk over to where you and <<print $girlfriend.firstname>> are, while the guys walk over to the other side of the net.

And even though you never did it while wearing a bikini, you know that you're good enough to hold your own. @@.thought;I just hope I'm good enough to beat all those strong guys.@@

Ashley serves the ball. One of the guys hits it back over the net, and it sails over your head. A girl in the back row hits it high in the air.

@@.thought;Oh shit, it's near me. Wait. I can spike it over.@@

You watch the volleyball like a hawk. And then, when it's just over your head, you leap up in the air and spike it over the net.

The ball quickly falls towards the ground. One of the guys starts towards it, but he can't get there in time.

@@.female;"Great job, girl!"@@ Ashley yells, giving you a high five. You're not thrilled about being called a girl, but you accept the high five. @@.thought;I scored a point! And it's not like I got lucky. That guys team looks really strong, and I scored on them!@@

You continue playing volleyball, surprising yourself with how much fun you're having. You've forgotten all about <<if $qb.date and $qb.date is "Morgan">>Morgan<<else>>your troubles<</if>>, and you've even forgotten that you're wearing a bikini. Instead, you're instead concentrating on the game.

It quickly becomes clear that you and Ashley are the two best players on the girls team. <<print $girlfriend.firstname>> and some of the other girls contribute, but you and Ashley keep scoring point after point.

But as good as you are, the guys team is just as good.

You continue playing volleyball, desperately praying that the ball doesn't come to you. You can't hit the ball over the net, and when you do hit it, someone else has to run over to where you are and hit it again so it's back in play. You had gotten used to being the worst player on your football team, but being the worst player on a team of girls is extra humiliating.

If this was your football team, they would all be making fun of you each time you messed up. But while it's clear that these girls are disappointed by your performance, nobody gives you a hard time.

@@.thought;I like this team much better.@@

The only thing your team has going for it is Ashley. She keeps making great spikes and serves, and is almost singlehandedly keeping your team in the game. <<print $girlfriend.firstname>> is also doing really well, and the other girls are all capable.

@@.thought;Good for her! Wait. She hit it towards me. Should I spike it over? No. That would be a disaster.@@

You put your palms out in front of you and set the volleyball in the direction of Ashley. She easily spikes it over the net and gives you a high five.
