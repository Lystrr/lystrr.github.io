The logo for the movie studio appears on the screen, and then //Undead Cruise Ship// starts playing. It follows a group of four friends who are about to take a cruise together. There's a jock, a cheerleader, a nerdy guy, and an uptight girl.

@@.player;"How are they friends?"@@ you ask out loud. @@.player;"They're so different!"@@ You can't think of any nerdy friends that you have. And you don't think you'd be friends with the uptight girl in real life.

@@.female;"Yeah! We're going to have a fun time! It beats sitting in our dusty old town!"@@

The group of friends all decide to board the cruise ship and, predictably, things start going wrong. The crew continues acting weird, their belongings start to go missing, and some of the other passengers start acting like the crew: silent, absent-minded and creepy.

The jock goes out onto the deck to "stretch his legs" and runs into a member of the crew. One thing leads to another, and they have sex. You feel a little bit of jealousy. Sure, something bad is obviously about to happen to him, but you'd love to be in that position, having sex with a beautiful woman. You're identifying with the jock, despite his boneheaded decisions, and that makes it all the more painful.

Suddenly, the jock starts to change. He shrinks several inches, his ass expands, and two orbs emerge from his chest.

You and <<print $qb.firstname>> get a dozen footballs from storage, and then jog back to the field.

@@.qb;"You first."@@

@@.player;"Sure."@@

He tosses half the footballs over to you. You pick up one of them, and hold it nervously in your hands. These six throws will decide if you can be the quarterback.

<<if $player.armStrength>=100>>You step back and throw a hard, tight pass. It spirals high in the air, but it doesn't take too long to get down the field. It bounces in the endzone, and <<print $qb.firstname>> turns to you.

@@.player;"I've still got five more to go,"@@ you say. You're no longer nervous about this competition. The old you is back.

You loft five more passes. Each one travels high in the air and lands in the end zone. By the time you've thrown the last one, you're beaming. These are the kinds of throws you were making before <<print $witch.firstname>>'s spell.

@@.player;"Your turn,"@@ you say, a little too confidently.

<<link "$qb.firstname swallows nervously" "QB SpellChallenge DistanceQB">><</link>><<elseif $player.armStrength>=60>>You step back and loft a pass high in the air. It spirals beautifully and you wait for it to land.

Finally, it bounces on the ground, just short of the end zone. @@.qb;"That must have been forty yards,"@@ <<print $qb.firstname>> says, impressed. You turn to look at him, and he swallows hard. @@.thought;He knows he could lose.@@

You smile inwardly, but then look at the pile of footballs at your feet. Your first throw was good but you still have five more passes to go.

Luckily, your nervousness is mostly gone. The rest of your throws get better and better, until the last one bounces down maybe one yard shy of the end zone.

@@.thought;I did good, but I never got into the end zone. If <<print $qb.firstname>> can, I'll lose.@@

<<link "$qb.firstname nods, trying to look confident" "QB SpellChallenge DistanceQB">><</link>><<elseif $player.armStrength>=30>>You step back and take a deep breath, then loft a pass high in the air.

It spirals beautifully, going up pretty high, but it comes down quickly. It maybe went twenty yards in total.

@@.player;"Me too,"@@ you say. @@.thought;I can lose some height on my pass if it'll go farther.@@

You take the next football, and take another deep breath. Concentrating on not throwing it too high, you release the football.

Taking the next football, you squeeze it in your hands. @@.thought;Come on. Why can't I do it? I just have to throw it farther.@@

You step back and then throw the football as hard as you can. It flies down the field, landing halfway to the end zone. @@.thought;That was about twenty five yards. Better.@@

The rest of your throws go the same way. The last one is almost thirty yards. @@.thought;I feel a little bit better@@ you think. @@.thought;But a quarterback who can barely throw the football thirty yards isn't much good.@@

@@.qb;"You're supposed to be throwing for distance,"@@ <<print $qb.firstname>> says.

@@.player;"I know,"@@ you say, trying not to look at him.

@@.qb;"You have to have a full delivery,"@@ <<print $qb.firstname>> says, walking over to you. @@.qb;"Like this."@@

He places an imaginary football in your hand, and then guides you through the motions of throwing it.

@@.qb;"You have to take a step forward,"@@ he says, placing his hand on your hips, as you take a step forward.

@@.thought;Even when we're competing, he's trying to help me out.@@

You thank him, and take the next football. Trying to remember his advice, you throw it down the field.

You know as soon as you release it that it's not going to be good enough. You were so busy trying to remember his advice that you messed up your delivery.

The next passes go a little farther. They all bounce on the ground maybe twelve to fifteen yards away from you.

@@.qb;"That was better!"@@ <<print $qb.firstname>> says.

Smiling, you get back to sucking. Each time, you challenge yourself to take more and more of his dick.
