You make it to the shuttle and climb inside. It's pretty empty, besides a couple of girls who are already wearing costumes. They're talking amongst themselves though, and aren't paying you any attention at all.

Eventually, the shuttle arrives in town, and you step out.

You're able to keep pace with him, but it's exhausting. Unlike the slow dance, you're not having fun. You probably would if you were able to relax, but you're too busy looking around you, keeping an eye on the girl you're mirroring, and making sure you don't step on Ryan's feet.
