New Oxford City is known as one of the manufacturing capitals of the northern part of Eurafrica, so the only dedicated houses were for the middle class administrative workers, a few scientists and the business owners - like my father. The rest of the population, nearly all slaves, lived in the factories themselves.\n\nThe factory we pulled up outside didn't seem to be one of ours though, as it bore the emblem of the Whittaker family. The son of that family, Tom, was a good friend of mine.\n\nGetting out, I saw our group assembling, composed of our teacher, Mr Wayne, and my three classmates. It was a point of pride for our family that I was in such a small class, something which they attribute to my academic abilities - although I'm fairly certain it was more to do with our money.\n\n&quot;@@.way;Ah, Mr Morton!

Even after having my slave chip removed, I would barely speak, and wouldn't move for myself.\n\nIn the end I was reinstalled at a nice upper class bath house. I was looked after better and had nicer food&lt;&lt;if $diet==&quot;Addictive Semen&quot;&gt;&gt;, even though it was still animal jizz (it turns out I'm addicted)&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;.

I'm surprised, however, by a low beep, as some tiles start to slide away in front of me.\n\nFrom beneath the floor tiles in front of me, a thick hose moves up and plugs onto my face, with straps going behind my head. A slight protrusion at the head of it pushes into my mouth, and a seal covers my &lt;&lt;if $mouth==&quot;pouty&quot;&gt;&gt;pouty&lt;&lt;elseif $mouth==&quot;dsl&quot;&gt;&gt;dick-sucking&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;pussy&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; lips.\n\nOpposite me, a hidden screen turns on, cunningly disguised in the wall tiles.

Somehow this seems even worse than human semen - at least they normally just shot it off on my face! Holding back from swallowing, the flow continues until my mouth is more or less full before cutting off.\n\nStuck with a mouth full of spunk, I realise I can't stay like this forever, and swallow it down. As I do, the flow begins anew until I'm forced to swallow once again. I thought that I had drank a lot before, but this is on another level. Soon, the hose reels back into the floor, leaving me with a belly full of animal jizz.

With my altered reflexes, however, there's little chance of me succeeding.

There doesn't seem to be any taste of raspberries, but I can just about sense the sour notes of lime.\n\nSwallowing it down, the boring mixture fills my stomach quite comfortably, until the hose finally disengaes and reels back into the floor.\n&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\nOozing into my mouth, my tongue is met with the salty tang of animal semen. Somehow this seems even worse than human semen - at least they normally just shot it off on my face! Holding back from swallowing, the flow continues until my mouth is more or less full before cutting off.\n\nStuck with a mouth full of spunk, I realise I can't stay like this forever, and swallow it down. As I do, the flow begins anew until I'm forced to swallow once again. I thought that I had drank a lot before, but this is on another level.

She went through a similar first day to me, and I reassured her like Gutterslut did to me, but I soon went back to my old popularity.\n\nEventually, it turns out that Tom managed to track me down, but I was too far gone to be returned to my former state. Even after having my slave chip removed, I would barely speak, and wouldn't move for myself.\n\nIn the end I was reinstalled at another bath house, this time a lot classier. I was looked after better and had nicer food&lt;&lt;if $diet==&quot;Addictive Semen&quot;&gt;&gt;, even though it was still animal jizz (it turns out I'm addicted)&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;.

It was at this point that people started to seriously consider settling on other bodies in the solar system.\n\nThe first fully independent Moon colony was declared completed in 2096, but it was still out of reach for the common folk back on Earth. With poverty only getting worse on the smog covered planet, and sea levels still rising dramatically, something was going to have to happen.\n\nAnd that something was slavery. With what little artificial intelligence that had been created, many automated operations still needed to be manned. This was mostly done from on-site sensor stations, where a team, or 'family', of slaves would look after a large facility in exchange for food and housing.\n\nWith the way the planet and economy were going, many saw this as a valid choice to make, and it wasn't all that bad for most. Even though they are technically owned, it was usually by a corporation, and quality of life wasn't bad.\n\nThis still left the majority of the population in the comfortable middle class of local government, scientific research and other jobs that a machine can't do.\n\nOur story, however, follows somebody who considers himself above either of these two groups: [[Sebastian Morton|1]]\n/%\nthe technological singularity. With the advent of strong artificial intelligence, the rich and powerful laid back on their laurels, their businesses practically ran themselves. And with processing power getting cheaper by the day, it wasn't long until most of the population found themselves in virtual reality for most of the time. Anything in 'realspace' was just too expensive.\n\nNow you might be thinking that this will inevitably lead to a Matrix-like scenario, but that would be ignoring the simple fact that humans still need to meet in real life to have sex. And, more importantly, //reproduce//.\n\nA century after that realisation, the population is finally stable again. It turns out that decontructing an enormous AI network is quite difficult. The gap between the richest and poorest is still present, but with a lowered population, it's not as pronounced as before. Except, that is, for slavery. \n\nWhile it turns out that\n\nQuality of life for all is quite high, as restrained AIs do most of the manual labour.\n\nThe main difference between the richer and the poorer, however, is augmented reality. While nearly everybody has a chip in their spine which projects directly into their vision, the richest humans use it as little as possible. They attend classes with human teachers, instead of getting a video streamed to them, and take part in physical sport and recreation.\n\n%/</div><div tiddler="hu4" tags="" created="201506081745" modifier="twee" twine-position="570,1830">I'm woken again in the morning by the same bell as before, and my feeding continues exactly the same as yesterday. &lt;&lt;if $diet==&quot;Gruel&quot;&gt;&gt;Today's flavour was blueberry and apple, and I could only just tell the difference from the raspberry and lime.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Today's flavour was 50% canine and 50% human - something I never thought I'd encounter.&lt;&lt;if $diet==&quot;Addictive Semen&quot;&gt;&gt; I will say, however, that it was slightly sweeter than the other day...&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n\n//I don't think I'll ever get used to this!//\n\nMy breakfast was followed by the same breeding as before, and I embarrasssingly came once again, maybe even slightly easier than my first time.

The added stimulation sends aftershocks of pleasure through my legs, as they twitch slightly.\n\nSoon though, Sam's knot has deflated enough for him to pull out, and a little of his semen drips out with it. Curiously, I can still feel an awful lot of it inside of me - my pussy seems to want to hold on to most of it.\n\nOnce we're apart, Sam leaves the room through the hatch he entered by, leaving me alone once again. Slumped on the ground, I can't bring myself to move, the effort too much.\n\n&quot;@@.mac;SOCIALISING COMPLETE.@@&quot;\n\nI lay like that for a while longer, still exhausted after my long day.

Catching a look at its collar, I found out the dog's name was Sam.\n\nAs Sam moves to one side, I see that the dog is most definitely male. A half sheathed, bright red cock bobs between his hind legs, already about 5 inches long, and some bulging testes nestle behind it.\n\n//I do ''not'' want that inside me!//\n\nI try to keep him in front of me and interested in my face, but Sam quickly circles around me and starts nuzzling my own crotch - which was already surprisingly wet. At the smell of this large dog, a peculiar warmth starts to suffuse my body.\n\nSam begins to lick at my pussy, which sends pulses of pleasure up my spine, until I start to not //want// to resist him. Eventually though, Sam raises himself up on his hind legs and plants himself against my back.\n\n//I seriously cannot be about to fuck a dog. This must be a dream!//\n\nLooking between my legs again, I see that his member has already expanded to a decent 8 inches, with a peculiar pointed tip. As Sam wraps his front legs around my waist, he starts to slowly hump, prodding me in the thighs.\n\nIt doesn't take long for him to reposition though, and he quickly thrusts again - impaling me on his doggy dick.\n\n&quot;@@.you;Ooooooooh~!@@&quot;\n\nI can't help but moan from the pleasure which I recieve from this, way more than I expected, and Sam just keeps pounding away at me. He keeps getting deeper, and I can feel him swelling up even more.\n\nThis continues, with Sam's fenzied humping and my feminine whines, until I start to feel something other than his hips thrusting up against me. An oddly firm but fleshy lump is pushing against my pussy, and getting deeper each time, until, with an audible pop, it fills me.\n\n//Fuck, he's knotted my cunt!//\n\nWith much less room to thrust, Sam decides instead to cum - and he cums hard. The force of his initial spurt almost distends my belly, and his hot white seed just keep coming, until I'm full to the brim with [[dog jizz|ca3]].</div><div tiddler="ca1" tags="" created="201505282251" modifier="twee" twine-position="430,1410">I wake up to the dull whirring of an old fashioned overhead fan.

On the opposite side there appears to be some kind of food bowl, with a hatch set into the wall above it.\n\nFeeling something around my neck, I reach up to find some sort of leather collar, with a tag at the front.

My story eventually leaked to the press and went viral, which led to a revolution in slave right - and years later to abolition entirely.\n\nI felt good that I had actually managed to do some good in the world, even if it was only my position that allowed me to. It's typical, a priviledged member of society goes through an ordeal that countless people go through daily, and people finally start to take notice.\n\n//~Ending 07 of 13: An Experience~//&lt;&lt;remember $fin=&quot;y&quot;,$e7=true&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;elseif $diet==&quot;Addictive Semen&quot;&gt;&gt;\nAfter being put in a dark, comfortable room, I was given some of the nicest food in the world.

As he placed a plate beside my bed, I smelt something on him - something from his crotch. The most delicious smell in the world, and I had to have it.\n\nLong story short, I found out that I was actually addicted to cum. It could be any sort, but usually I went for Tom's, direct from the source. It was only once I'd been given access to this that I started to come out of my shell.\n\nAfter so long in this form, I eventually decided to stay much the same and live with Tom, as his girlfriend slash bitch.\n\n//~Ending 08 of 13: Tom's Bitch~// &lt;&lt;remember $fin=&quot;y&quot;,$e8=true&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="ca4" tags="" created="201506011524" modifier="twee" twine-position="430,1690">The next morning, I was woken with a start by the announcement of feeding, for which I dragged myself to my bowl again. After that, Sam was again let into the room, where I was bred with as much vigour as yesterday.\n\nAgain in the afternoon I was mounted, although this time by a different dog, Marcus. He was a little bigger than Sam, but gentler. I hate to admit it, but these breeding sessions were starting to grow on me...\n\nThis routine carried on for a couple of days, until I noticed my belly start to swell, no doubt with a litter of pups.\n\n//How is that even possible? And so quickly?!//\n\nThe breeding continued, as my belly quickly grew to obscene proportion. One day, after a week or so, a twinge of pain let me know that I was going into labour.\n\nWith the help of some machinery, I gave birth then and there to a healthy litter of 6 strong puppies. These were quickly taken away, although I still couldn't help but think of them as my own.\n&lt;&lt;if $time=='1'&gt;&gt;\nOnce my labour was finished, I felt abnormally tired, quickly falling into a deep [[sleep.|end5]]\n&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\nOnce my labour was finished, I was given little respite before one of the dogs was let in again, and my breeding was continued as vigorously as before.\n\nMy life continued like this, with my food not changing at all. &lt;&lt;if $diet==&quot;Gruel&quot;&gt;&gt;I soon got used to the dog food, and even started to look forward to meal times, as I did for my breedings - the high point of my day.&lt;&lt;elseif $diet==&quot;Semen&quot;&gt;&gt;I didn't ever really grow used to the taste of cum, but lapped it up nonetheless.

I'd grown so attached to Sam and Brutus that I wouldn't leave them even with my slave chip disabled.\n\nTom finally decided to take all three of us to his house, where I lived the rest of my days as a happy house pet, and a devoted bitch.\n\n//~End 06 of 13: Broken Bitch~//&lt;&lt;remember $fin=&quot;y&quot;,$e6=true&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n</div><div tiddler="2" tags="" created="201505231527" modifier="twee" twine-position="430,10">Opening my eyes, I looked around my //actual// bedroom.

There were people lining up to fuck me, but after the first few people, they all seemed to reach a consensus.\n\nMost times when people fucked my pussy or arse, they would often pull out and shoot over my butt, or face if it was free. This time, though, they all decided to empty their balls inside of me. On the other side, everybody using my &lt;&lt;if $mouth==&quot;vag&quot;&gt;&gt;vagina &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;mouth pulled out and came all over my face.\n\nSoon enough, I felt completely full of jizz.\n\nIt didn't stop there, though. Somebody mananged to get a wrench into the bathroom, and started messing with my harness. As they finished, my stand was turned around so I was facing the other direction.\n\n//There are a hell of a lot of guys in this queue...//\n\nThis continued practically non-stop until the lull, which I learnt was due to the slaves dinner time.\n\nI thought my final ordeal was over, but the beeping behind me reminded me of my [[feeding...|slv5]]</div><div tiddler="Name" tags="" created="201505242231" modifier="twee" twine-position="10,850">After making that selection, Tom seems like he's about to make a comment, until he sees what pops up on the screen.\n\n&quot;@@.tom;Oh, cool!

Kept in a dark, comfortable room, I was slowly introduced back to the world and to regular food.

My story eventually leaked to the press and went viral, which led to a revolution in slave right - and years later to abolition entirely.\n\nI felt good that I had actually managed to do some good in the world, even if it was only my position that allowed me to.

As he placed a plate beside my bed, I smelt something on him - something from his crotch. The most delicious smell in the world, and I had to have it.\n\nLong story short, I found out that I was addicted to cum. It could be from any source, but usually I went for Tom's, direct from his balls. It was only once I'd been given access to this that I started to come out of my shell.\n\nAfter so long in this form, I eventually decided to stay much the same and live with Tom, as his girlfriend slash bitch.\n\n//~Ending 08 of 13: Tom's Bitch~//&lt;&lt;remember $fin=&quot;y&quot;,$e8=true&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="pr5" tags="" created="201505251654" modifier="twee" twine-position="990,990">Once inside, the video feed cuts out again, and I get a sinking feeling as more mechanical arms stretch out to restrain me.\n\n//This can't be good...//\n\n&quot;@@.mac;APPLYING DERMAL SOFTENER.@@&quot;\n\nNow held tightly in position, a spray starts covering me in a creamy foam.
