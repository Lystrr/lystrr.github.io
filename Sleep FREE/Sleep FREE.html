To be fair, they'd seen better days and she'd given her own for you to wear which you don't mind admitting you're happy about. Her silky knickers feel so good against your skin and the thought makes you hard.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n\nMiss Riven talks enthusiastically about the partial reinforcement effect - that intermittent reinforcement is more effective than continual, leading on to two kinds of effective reinforcement patterns - fixed schedule/variable ratios.\n\n'If the subject is continually rewarded throughout the conditioning process, it will stop the conditioned behaviour and cease to associate the stimuli, whereas a subject conditioned with intermittent reinforcement won't expect reward as much so will likely continue the conditioned behaviour even when denied the reward.'\n\n'A parent who yields to a nagging child is unwittingly teaching their child to nag (or wittingly perhaps if they want their child to grow up into someone persistent).\n\nBehaviourists believe there are no innate learning/desires which we now know isn't true.\n\nAlso, contrary to the Behaviourist idea - animals (inc humans) don't need reward/punishment to learn.\n\nThe Garcia effect states that innate learning means that some stimuli/behaviours are pre-associated like pecking/food/hunger, flapping/danger/fear. i.e. Pain/fear won't likely make you develop an aversion to a new food but nausea will because food and nausea are pre-associated/conditioned.\n\nNot everything is learned. The debate lies in how much is innate.\nUnobservable evidence no longer seen as unscientific (necessarily)\nReward/punishment isn't necessary to learn\nNatural responses differentiate subjects (Garcia effect)\n\nShe wraps up by explaining that Behaviourism has falsifyability issues in that it's either trivially true or scientifically robust and obviously false but adding:\n\n'Behaviourism has faded but has left us with some useful ideas and techniques and stands as an important contribution.'\n\nShe wraps it up right [[in time for lunch]].\n</div><div tiddler="explrdmch" tags="" created="201801012230" modifier="twee" twine-position="6870,2250"></div><div tiddler="sign" tags="" created="201711081128" modifier="twee" twine-position="6030,1130">&lt;&lt;if $read is true&gt;&gt;You carefully read the documents and find nothing disconcerting enough to put you off so you sign.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You skim the documents and find nothing disconcerting enough to put you off.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n\nYou look sideways at &lt;&lt;if $change is true&gt;&gt;Sasha&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;your Mother&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;, who smiles at you supportively, before putting pen to paper.\n\nYou almost sign as &lt;&lt;print $fnom&gt;&gt; but realise you're still legally &lt;&lt;print $nom&gt;&gt;.\n\n&lt;&lt;if $change is true&gt;&gt;'It's okay Sugar.'

'Hey Rachel!'\n\nWith morning sunshine on your face, you ride in Charlie's passenger seat feeling freer than ever before.\n\n'Gonna pick Aiya up.' Charlie says simply.\n\nYour thoughts return to the mysterious man with the gun secretly holstered under his jacket. You'd try to broach the conversation again with Charlie but in no time, you're at Aiyas house.\n\n'C'mon.'

So what's with your gangster sugar daddy?'// \n\nAs Charlie approaches, the front door opens and Aiya lets the pair of you in.\n\n'Oh &lt;&lt;print $fnom&gt;&gt;!! I can't believe it! - I must admit I never thought you had the guts!' she laughs.\n\n'Oh, er - thanks.' you respond. Not really sure if it's a compliment or not.\n\nYou find Aiya's Dad in the front room. 'Hi girls!' he greets you.\n\n'Hey Ken!' Charlie returns.\n\n'Hello.' you offer him timidly from the doorway.\n\nHe looks in your direction. 'Hello Gorgeous!' he says as if to the love of his life. 'Are you off now?'\n\nYou're not sure. You suppose you'll have to go soon if you're to be at college on time but...\n\nHe walks towards you.\n\n...but he's not looking at you - you realise - he's looking about a foot directly above you above you. You sense somebody behind you and step out of the way.\n\nA big man steps in through the doorway and envelops Aiya's Dad in a loving embrace which finishes in a lingering kiss between their lips. You recognise him instantly.\n\n//Aiya's sugar...oh...//\n\n'Yeah, I'd better go.' he says, letting go of Aiya's Dad.\n\n'Morning Daddy!'

'...have fun at college Aiya - and be good, won't you?' he tells her.\n\n'Why yes Daddy!' she responds in mock surprise at the implication that she perhaps might not.\n\nWith that, the man steps back into the hallway and exits through the front door.\n\nSoon after that, you and Aiya join Charlie in her car and she heads for college.\n\nOn the way you quiz Aiya about her other dad, explaining how you saw he was carrying a gun.\n\n'My dad's a cop.' she says from the front passenger seat.\n\n'He's a narc.'

'Let's get you dressed nicely for college huh?'\n\nShe pulls off and heads down the road. You think she's going to take you to her's but she stops at Aiya's instead.\n\n'C'mon.'

'I'm gonna lend you one of my uniforms as you're about the same size as me.\n\n'Thanks Aiya but I'm still not sure how this is going to work!' you say with hushed urgency.\n\n'I told you I'd sort it &lt;&lt;print $fnom&gt;&gt; - I sorted it.' Charlie reassures you. 'Just get your skinny ass in the front room and get changed. I'll explain everything later.'\n\nThe pair of them shepherd you into the front room where Aiya's spare uniform lies folded up on a particularly tasteful sofa.\n\n'Here?' you say, unsure.\n\n'Yes here - come on, chop chop.' Charlie says impatiently.\n\nYou shrug and start taking off all your clothes. When you're standing there butt naked in front of them both, Charlie starts handing you garments to put on, starting with a pair of little white panties, then a pair of frilly white pop socks, then an A cup bra to match the panties, then another pair of socks to stuff inside your bra, a shirt, a skirt and a little plaid tie to match the skirt.\n\n'You want help doing your make up?' Charlie asks.\n\nYou tell her you think you can cope now. She seems happy by that.\n\nAiya directs you to the bathroom so you can use the mirror and you head upstairs and close the door behind you.\n\nYou're almost done and just trying to make your hair look more girly when the bathroom door opens and a stark naked man with a massive floppy willy walks in. You recognise him instantly, freezing in shock.\n\n'Oh, hey - sorry lil Miss! - I didn't know anyone was in here.' he says and backs out again, closing the door behind him. It's unmistakably the guy who met up with Aiya - the guy who had a gun secretly holstered under his jacket.\n\n'Holy shit!' you breathe. //Is Aiya crazy? - bringing her psycho sugar daddy home with her.//\n\nYou wonder if Aiya's Dad knows about this guy and how he'd react if he saw a man twice Aiya's age walking around butt naked in his house!\n\nQuickly finishing up, you exit the bathroom and nearly bump into Aiya's Dad. 'Oh - hey Mr...' you start before realising you've forgotten their family's surname. '...Ken.' you finish.\n\n//Shit! - where's the naked guy gone!?// you wonder frantically, deciding this could all go horribly wrong.\n\n'Oh hey &lt;&lt;print $fnom&gt;&gt;!' Aiya's dad greets you warmly. You're surprised he remembers you. 'Excited for your first day at college?' he asks you pleasantly.\n\n'Uh, yeah - yes thanks.' you say but you're more concerned with the fact that he looks to be heading downstairs and you don't know where the naked guy is.\n\nYou follow him downstairs and into the front room where you can see the girls, sitting on the sofa.\n\n'Morning Honey!' Ken says lovingly as he steps into the front room.\n\nAt that moment, the naked guy - now wearing a towel around his midrif, steps into view. 'Morning beautiful!' he says to Aiya's Dad.\n\nFor a moment you're still confused - all the way up to the point when the couple embrace and passionately kiss each other on the lips.\n\n//Ahhhh-riiight.// you think, nodding your head to yourself as the penny finally drops.\n\nAs Ken greets Aiya and Charlie, the man in the towel approaches you.\n\n'Hi, sorry about that earlier - I'm Marco.'\n&lt;&lt;set $Marco = true&gt;&gt;\nAfter a minimal conversation, Aiya's other Dad goes upstairs, presumably to do whatever it was he was intending to do earlier.\n\nYou're left in the room with Ken and the girls.\n\n'Well I'd better better get back in the office.' he says. 'Have a fabulous day girls!'\n\nThe three of you leave soon after that and Aiya calls shotgun again.\n\nOn the way you quiz Aiya about her other dad Marco, explaining how you saw he was carrying a gun.\n\n'My dad's a cop.' she says from the front passenger seat.\n\n'He's a narc.'

'Why do we have a consciousness?' and 'Why is so much of our mind's activity unconscious?'\n\nShe explains that one theory is that being unaware of what really motivates us makes deception easier.\n\n'We spend so much time pretending to be something we're not and it's easier to deceive others if you believe it yourself.'\n\nThe class centres around Behaviourism - a partially redundant school of psychology with an emphasis on learning, of which there are three types.\n\nThe first (and simplest form) being Habituation - getting desensitised/used to things.\n\nThen Classical Conditioning - the attributing of associations between stimuli, learning through exposure.\n\n'Classical Conditioning can be used to shape our desires.'\n\nAs you hear Miss Riven speak the sentence, something about it seems important.\n\n'...Sexual desires can be controlled/altered using these techniques during masturbation.' she goes on. It's weird to you that Miss Riven is talking about masturbation and sexual desires.\n\n''Break time'' if schgirl - if schboy+ifMumknows/else\n\nAfter break, she talks about the third type of learning in Behaviourist theory - Operant Conditioning; of positive and negative reinforcements utilised to reward or punish a subject to a desired behaviour via approximations of that behaviour.\n\n/%Positive reinforcement - add reward or punishment\n\nNegative reinforcement - remove reward or punishment%/\n\nShe talks about the partial reinforcement effect - that intermittent reinforcement is more effective than continual, leading on to two kinds of effective reinforcement patterns - fixed schedule/variable ratios.\n\n'If the subject is continually rewarded throughout the conditioning process, it will stop the conditioned behaviour and cease to ascociate the stimuli, whereas a subject conditioned with intermittent reinforcement won't expect reward as much so will likely continue the conditioned behaviour even when denied the reward.'\n\n'A parent who yeilds to a nagging child is unwittingly teaching their child to nag (or wittingly perhaps if they want their child to grow up into someone persistent).\n\nBehaviourists believe there are no innate learning/desires which we now know isn't true.\n\nAlso, contrary to the Behaviourist idea - animals (inc humans) don't need reward/punishment to learn.\n\nThe Garcia effect states that innate learning means that some stimuli/behaviours are pre-associated like pecking/food/hunger, flapping/danger/fear. i.e. Pain/fear won't likely make you develop an aversion to a new food but nausea will because food and nausea are pre-associated/conditioned.\n\nNot everything is learned. The debate lies in how much is innate.\nUnobservable evidence no longer seen as unscientific (necessarily)\nReward/punishment isn't necessary to learn\nNatural responses differentiate subjects (Garcia effect)\n\nShe wraps up by explaining that Behaviourism has falsifyability issues in that it's either trivially true or scientifically robust and obviously false but adding:\n\n'Behaviourism has faded but has left us with some useful ideas and techniques and stands as an important contribution.'\n\n''Lunch''\n\nAfter lunch, the class is shown videos of conditioning experiments. There's one with a dog and a bell, some people recovering from phobias and a clip from the movie A Mechanical Manderin.\n\nMiss Riven takes time to chat with you all about the lesson before the afternoon period comes to an end.\n\n/%\n\n''//Original Notes//''\n\nB F Skinner\nUnconscious\n\nwhy do we have a consciousness?\n\nwhy do we have an unconscious?\n\nDeception\n\nWe spend so much time pretending to be something we're not\n\nIt's easier to deceive if you believe yourself\n\n\nFreud - psychoanalysis\n\nBehaviourism - before Skinner (John Watson) Skinner popularised behaviourism\n\nBehaviourism - emphasis on learning.\n\nJesuits - give me a child and I'll show you the man\n\nWatson - give me lots of children and I'll make them whatever\n\nAnti-mentalism - stimulus/response\n\nForms of learning - \nHabituation (the simplest form) - getting used to things/desensitised\n\nClassical Conditioning - learning the association between stimuli (Pavlov's dog (wanted to study saliva))\n\nUnconditioned stimulus (food) - unconditioned response (saliva) - didn't have to learn\nNeutral stimulus (bell)\nUnconditioned stimulus (bell) - unconditioned response (saliva) - learned association\nContinued exposure makes Neutral stimulus (bell) into a conditioned stimulus.\nConditioned stimulus (bell) - conditioned response (saliva)\n\nUnreinforced conditioning (without bell) causes Extinction\n\nSystematic desensitisation - curing of phobias by use of Unreinforced Conditioning\n\nSpontaneous recovery\n\nClassical Conditioning can be used to shape our desires.\n\n//Controlled during masturbation//\n\nPreparation for a pre-empted event\n\nClockwork Orange - \nUnconditioned stimulus (drug) - unconditioned response (nausea)\nShown scenes of violence until a (negative) association between violence and nausea forms.\nConditioned stimulus (violence) - conditioned response (nausea)\n\n\nOperant Conditioning - \n\nPositive reinforcement - add reward or punishment\n\nNegative reinforcement - remove reward or punishment\n\n\nBy rewarding the subject for approximations to the desired behaviour\nBy punishing the subject for diversions from the desired behaviour\n\nRatio - fixed schedule/variable\n\nPartial reinforcement effect - don't reinforce all the time but intermittently.\n\nSubject doesn't expect reward as much so continues behaviour even when denied.\n\nKid  - Muuum, can I?\nMum - no, no, no, yes.\n\nTraining kid to nag.\n\nBehaviourists believe no innate learning/desires - wrong\n\nAlso, contrary to the Behaviourist idea - animals (inc humans) don't need reward/punishment to learn.\n\nGarcia effect states that innate learning means that some stimuli/behaviours are pre-associated like pecking/food/hunger, flapping/danger/fear. i.e. Pain/fear won't likely make you develop an aversion to a new food but nausea will because food and nausea are pre-associated/conditioned.\n\nNot everything is learned.

You seem to have ended up with a white one with a big baby pink heart on.\n\n‘Oh fuck! I nearly forgot the washing!’ Charlie says, getting up and heading back downstairs.\n\nYou chat with Sasha and Bibi while Aiya refreshes her memory on something called an ‘Elman Induction’.\n\n‘Uh...Bibi...?’ Charlie calls from the bottom of the stairs.\nHer voice sounds ominous and you all pay attention.\n\n‘Is this your nice new pink mini dress?’\n\nYou all look at Bibi and watch her expression change to one of horror.\n\nShe seems to fly off the bed and down the stairs. ‘OMG Charlie! – is it OK?!’\n\nThe rest of you follow in curiosity.\n\n‘//It//’s okay...’ she starts. ‘...but I’m pretty certain not everything I put in was this lovely shade of pink to begin with – especially not these jeans.’ Charlie holds your jeans up for all to see.\n\n‘Oh fuck.’ //Your favourite pair of pristine white jeans. You had so far managed to thoroughly impress your mother by keeping them immaculate.//\n\nThey’re now a decidedly pink shade of pink – truly the pinkest shade of pink in existence.\n\n‘Oops!’ giggles Bibi. ‘I’m really sorry &lt;&lt;print $nom&gt;&gt;! I’ll buy you a new pair!’\n\n‘Shopping trip!’ Charlie and Sasha say in unison.\n\n‘That’s okay Bibi....’ you start before Charlie cuts in.\n\n‘We can all head to the Mall tomorrow, yeah?’\n\nThe others all seem happy with the idea.\n\n‘OK...’ Aiya starts, putting the book to one side again. ‘Face me and relax.’ She tells you.\n\nThis proves difficult with the other girls making you giggle but Aiya persists.\n\nShe asks you a few innocuous questions and you wonder if you should pretend to get hypnotised, just so she doesn’t feel bad when it doesn’t work.\n\nYou feel someone tap you on the back of the head and Aiya pulls you in to nestle against her shoulder.\n\nYou feel so comfortable there that you just get lost in the moment...\n\nYou hear her voice murmering softly in your ear...\n\nYou feel so relaxed...\n\nEven when you feel your body pushed gently upright...\n\nAiya instructs you to behave like a 'bitch puppy'. It seems like a perfectly reasonable thing to ask of someone so you do what she asks.\n\n‘Ruff.’\n\n‘Good puppy.’ She says. The bed’s not for puppies though is it?’\n\n‘Get off the bed - now.’\n\nYou climb down onto the floor where you’re supposed to be.\n\nYou can hear laughing from somewhere. It makes you feel happy.\n\n‘You try.’ Aiya says.\n\nYou don’t understand the command.\n\n‘OK, sit.’ Charlie tells you.\n\nYou do as you’re told.\n\n‘Good girl!’\n\n‘Look at me.’\n\nYou look up at Charlie. 'Are you going to be compliant?'\n\nShe takes a jelly sweet from Bibi.\n\n‘You want this?’ she asks, holding it just out of reach.\n\n‘Beg.’ She tells you.\n\nYou put your paws up against your chest and look up at your Mistress hopefully, your tongue slightly protruding from your open mouth.\n\n‘Aaaaand – catch!’ she says, tossing the sweet in the air towards you.\n\nYou don’t quite manage to catch it so you eat it when it lands.\n\nYou look up at the girls. They’re all laughing at you but you don’t understand why. It doesn’t matter though.\n\n‘Come here puppy!’ comes Sasha’s voice.\n\nYou follow it happily to where her feet are hanging off the side of the bed.\n\nYou see she now has a treat.\n\n‘Beg for me.’\n\nYou do as she asks, this time making little whining noises.\n\n‘Aw, here you go.’ She says, feeding you the sweet from her open palm.\n\n‘Good puppy.’ She tells you, patting your head.\n\n‘Roll over.’ Charlie tells you do, laying on your back with your legs in the air.\n\nSasha and Charlie give your tummy a rub and you feel happy.\n\nBibi, sniggering, tells you to come to her so you do.\n\nShe shows you a jelly dildo 'fetch!' she says, before throwing it across the room.\n\nIt lands in Charlie's laundry basket and it's a while before you manage to retrieve it.\n\nBibi pats you on the head. 'Good puppy!' she tells you, taking the dildo from your mouth.\n\n‘OK, give me your foot.’ She says to Charlie. Charlie obliges and she puts a sweet in between her toes.’\n\n‘Give him that.’ She suggests to Charlie. Uh-uh, it’s ‘her’ now Bibi.’ She scolds. ‘Isn’t that right puppy?’\n‘You show her that you agree.\n‘You’re a little bitch puppy aren’t you darlin’?’ She continues.\n\nYou wag your imaginary tail to indicate that you agree wholeheartedly.\n\n‘Come take this treat.’ She says, offering her foot.\n\nYou put your mouth around her toes and take the treat gleefully.\n\nYou hear Aiya [[snap her

Clearly he takes care of his plants and it smells divine but it's not exactly maintained like a show garden.\n\n'It's organised chaos.' he laughs as if reading your thoughts. 'Here, let me get this for you.' he offers, taking a step ladder. He sets it up under the tree. 'You look cute in your PJ's.' he says, looking over his shoulder.\n\nYou think he means it. Either way, you blush profusely.\n\n//What is that beautiful smell?// you wonder, looking around at the various blooms nearby. Whatever it is, it seems to make you feel a little light headed but you reason that might be simply on account of you breathing more than you need.\n\n'...but if I'm honest, I'd sooner see you in your college uniform.' he grins and you blush all the more. 'I tell you what, &lt;&lt;print $fnom&gt;&gt;. As you and I have no secrets between us, I want you to feel comfortable wearing what you like around me.' he tells you. 'Why don't you go and dress up now? You'd like that wouldn't you?'\n\nYou feel a little bit funny. //Maybe you're just horny.// 'Yes.' you nod.\n\nHis face is kind as he smiles at you. 'The prettier you are, the more plums you can have, how about that?'\n\n'Thank you Mr Green.\n\n'Go on then &lt;&lt;print $fnom&gt;&gt; - come back soon!'\n\n'Okay.' you tell him and scamper off back home.\n\nBeing as you are now thoroughly adept at swiftly changing into your uniform, it takes you no time at all.\n\nIn the back of your mind a voice asks you &lt;p style=&quot;font-size:12px;&quot;&gt;//What are you doing?//&lt;/p&gt; but you continue applying the finishing touches to your make up.\n\n//It's exciting having a new person to share my secret with.// you decide.\n\nThe sentiment however, begins to fade as you make your way to the back garden and that little voice becomes a little louder. //What are you doing &lt;&lt;print $fnom&gt;&gt;!?//\n\nStill, you walk out through the back gate and return to Mr Green's garden.\n\nYou can't see him around and wonder for a moment if you ought to just go back but just as you begin to ponder that option, you catch a whiff of that beautiful scent again.\n\n//Oh wow, that smells so good.// you breathe deeply and find that your anxiety has turned back into excitement.\n\nYou catch yourself delicately stroking your neck with the tips of your fingers.\n\nMr Green's voice comes from somewhere close behind you. 'Mmm, mmm.'\n\nStartled, you look around to where he's standing.\n\n'Oh, hello Mr Green. I came back.' you say, stating the obvious.\n\n'So I see.' He smiles and shakes his head. '&lt;&lt;print $fnom&gt;&gt;, you do make the cutest girl.'\n\nYou feel yourself blush deeply. 'I should probably just get the plums and...what is that smell?' you ask. 'It's really nice whatever it is.'\n\n'I don't know.' He shrugs. 'Which one? There are so many.'\n\n'It's a bit like rose but sweet like candyfloss.' you tell him.\n\n'Ah, not a bad description if you mean these.' he goes to a trailing plant with delicate shimmery pink veined white petals and carefully picks one. He holds it up to your nose to breathe its fragrance.\n\nA sudden rush of libidinousness fills you to the brim and your breath catches in your throat. You feel confused and weak kneed.\n\nMr Green steps up and slips a hand around the small of your back, holding the bloom up close for you to see.\n\n'It's beautiful.' you tell him.\n\n&lt;img src=&quot;Sleep_img/Mr Green/primis.jpg&quot;&gt;\n\n'Primis Cupiditatem' he tells you, adding; 'It's one of mine.' which strikes you as odd.\n\n//Of course it's one of his.//\n\n'I think it'd look pretty, here.' he tells you, slipping the stalk into your hair.\n\nYou look up into his eyes.\n\n'Perfect.' he tells you.\n\nYou say nothing. You think you might want him to kiss you and he seems to notice you looking back and forth between his eyes and mouth.\n\n'Would you like me to pick them for you?' he asks and for a moment you're not sure what he's talking about.\n\n'Oh, er yes, um no, no thank you. I can manage.' you tell him and go to the ladder.\n\nYou put your hands on the sides and place a foot upon the first rung, pausing for a moment. //Oh god I'm so horny!// you think, noticing also how your cock is still soft.\n\n'Would you like me to hold it for you?' Mr Green asks.\n\n'Wha- oh er, thank you.'\n\nHe moves up behind you and holds the ladder still as you make your way up, step by step. You're suddenly aware that his head is about level with your bottom and if you go up any higher, he'd be able to see right up your pleated skirt.\n\nYou look down behind you and he's there with a look of encouragement on his face. 'One more step and you should be able to reach them.'\n\nYou turn back around and go up to the last step. Mr Green holds the ladder firm as you reach up into the branches and seek out the best plums.\n\n'You probably want riper one's than that &lt;&lt;print $fnom&gt;&gt;.' Mr Green tells you.\n\n'No - I uh, is it okay if I pick the firmer ones? I prefer them firm.'\n\n'Huh, yeah sure. If that's what you like.' he says.\n\nYou pass down a few plums to him and he takes them from you, putting them in a little container.\n\n'What did you want them for? Cooking or...?'\n\nInexplicably, you turn around and begin to tell him. 'I wanted something to put in my bum.'\n\nThe blurt catches you by surprise and you clamp one hand up to cover your mouth. 'I'm so sorry Mr Green, I don't know why I told you that.'\n\nHe looks definitely surprised but he laughs anyway. 'That's okay &lt;&lt;print $fnom&gt;&gt;, you can tell me anything.'\n\nFor a moment you just try to pretend that bit never happened and resume picking fruit and passing them down to him. 'That should be more than enough.'\n\nYou realise this whole situation ought to seem more stressful but as embarrassed as you are, everything feels weird, almost like when you know you're in a dream only instead of things being vague and intangible, here everything seems if anything more vivid as if your senses are heightened. Most of all, you feel unbearably horny.\n\nAs you come down the ladder, you feel Mr Green's hand against your bottom. 'I've got you.' he says but then he doesn't let you down any further. Instead, you feel the other hand smooth up your leg, causing your breath to become more shallow and rapid. You know what he wants and you're surprised by the realisation that you want it too.\n\nThe hand continues up to the hem of your skirt and the other mirrors it on the other side, pushing it up over your bottom, exposing your panties. In the next moment, you feel his hot breath against your crotch and a shiver goes all the way through your body. You don't look behind you, just hold onto the ladder and allow him to do what he wants with you.\n\nYou feel his face push in between your cheeks and his mouth as he tries to eat you through the material. You aren’t any harder than you were before but you're as horny as you've ever been and ready to offer yourself to him completely.\n\nYou want him to just roughly grab your knickers and tear them off you but he pulls them down over your bottom at such an unbearably slow pace that by the time, they reach your ankles; you're half crazy with desire.\n\nHe lifts one foot, then the other momentarily off the rung so he can free you of your underwear, making sure that you're standing with your legs slightly apart.\n\nYou feel him kiss the backs of your legs from the ankle and increasingly higher up to the backs of your knees then thighs and buttocks. You feel him pull your cheeks apart and his hot breath against your smooth, pink hole.\n\nYou're only half aware that you’re begging him to fuck you under your breath. \n\nWhen his tongue pushes against your substitute pussy, you relax and let it enter with little resistance.\n\nYou moan softly to yourself as his tongue pushes wetly into your ass hole, opening it up and making it hungry for more.\n\nWhen he stops, you turn around to plead for more. You see him reach into the container of plums and pick out a nice, shiny one.\n\nHe pushes his tongue back in your bottom a couple more times before you feel the plum against your hole. Mr Green pushes it steadily against your relenting hole until it pops inside.\n\nYou make a 'Mmmm.' noise and beg him to put more in.\n\nYou soon feel a second plum pressed against your hole until it pops inside and joins the other.\n\n'Are you going to take another one like a good girl?' Mr Green asks you.\n\nYou tell him you want it and he puts a third inside you.\n\n'There you go.' Mr Green says as it slips inside you. 'Now, pop down for me.' he says and helps you down from the ladder. He turns you around with one hand at the small of your back and the other at the nape of your neck. 'Open your mouth.' he tells you softly. As you comply, he leans in and puts his mouth upon yours. You feel his tongue slip inside and you allow it.\n\nWhen he pulls away, you look up at him with desperation in your eyes. 'Please fuck me Mr Green.' you beg.\n\nHe grins. 'Not until you've had your plums.' he laughs. 'You wanted plums and I'm going to make sure you get all of them okay.' You nod uncertainly, look down at how many plums there are left in the container and feel even less certain.\n\n'Come over here.' he tells you firmly and leads you over to a smooth rock by a little water garden surrounded by the trailing white flowers. He sits on it and guides you gently to sit down upon his lap. With the tips of his fingers, he guides you to look at him. 'Are you going to be a little slut for me now angel?' he asks you. Maybe you should be unhappy at being spoken to like this but it makes you feel sexy, and beautiful. You nod.\n\n'Good.' he says simply, then effortlessly puts you over his lap and pulls up your skirt. Reaching into the container, he takes another plum and forces it against your ass. You submit to the intrusion and it pops inside you with the other three.\n\n'There you go.' he says, caressing your ass cheeks.\n\nA moment later and a fifth plum is being pushed against your ass. A sixth and seventh follow that and by the eighth, you're feeling very full.\n\nBy the time you have twelve plums inside you, your ass is stretched to full capacity and your mind is unable to focus on anything but the overwhelming sensation of fullness.\n\nA trickle of precum drools from the tip of your cocklett to the grass. You whimper pitifully before losing control of your sphincter and unleashing a torrent of shiny plums from your backside.\n\n'Oh, look what you did!' says Mr Green.\n\n'I'm sorry Mr Green - I didn't mean to.' you tell him as he spanks you quite roughly over his lap.\n\n//Why is being treated like this turning me on?// you wonder hazily.\n\n'Am I going to have to put my cock in you now young lady?' Mr Green asks rhetorically. 'Come here.' he tells you, positioning you down on the grass between his knees. 'Have you ever sucked a man's cock &lt;&lt;print $fnom&gt;&gt;?' he asks you.\n\nYou shake your head. 'No.' you tell him.\n\n'Well then, it's about time you learned isn't it?' he asks you and you nod your head obediently.\n\nMr Green opens his shorts and releases his already half erect penis. You kneel there full of fear and excitement, of disgust at the monstrous thing and surprise at how much you want to taste it.\n\nYou let Mr Green guide your head to it. You breathe it in. It smells quite pleasant in a strange sort of way. You brush your lips against his foreskin that leaves a glistening strand of precum in the space between. You lick it from your lips to taste it. You feel Mr Green's hands guide you forward and your mouth opens for his fleshy tool.\n\nYour first taste of cock! From that moment, you know you're hooked. You want to worship it and taste his cum. You do your best not to disappoint Mr Green and try your best to relax as he slides his cock ever deeper into your throat.\n\nYou're embarrassed when you gag but he doesn't seem to mind and you think he might even like it so you continue to let him fuck your mouth while you submit to him on your hands and knees.\n\n'There's a good girl.' he says to you as his balls start slapping against your chin. He sounds really impressed and that makes you feel really proud of yourself.\n\nWhile you service him, you feel his finger press against your ass hole and start to work in and out of it. You don't mind; it belongs to him now as far as you're concerned and when he starts putting the plums back inside you, you let him.\n\nLong, thick strands of saliva hang from his balls as he thrusts deeply into your throat. Mr Green starts making guttural noises and you think he might be about to cum. You want to taste it so much but instead, he pulls out and pushes you onto your back. Pinning you down, he pulls up your skirt and guides the tip of his penis to your abused hole.\n\nYou feel his bulbous glans nudge its way inside you, causing you to whimper. It's slick with your saliva and slides smoothly in and out of your bottom. He looks at you like you're the most beautiful thing he's ever laid eyes on and leans close to taste your mouth.\n\nThe sensation builds as Mr Green plunges his cock balls deep into your ass and you feel ever more certain you're going to cum. You raise and part your legs a little more so that he can get in as deep as possible. He takes the queue to fuck you even harder and you feel like you're going to pass out.\n\nYou start squealing like a girl and with Mr Green's big cock, plunging relentlessly into your bottom, your floppy little cocklett spurts a string of cum onto your tummy.\n\nHe pulls out and kneels either side of your head, fapping off in your face. You lay there, semi-conscious as a torrent of hot sperm rains down upon your face, splashing into your open mouth.\n\nYou swallow it down blissfully.\n\nYou lay there together in the sun while you catch your breath.\n\n'&lt;&lt;print $nom&gt;&gt;!?' comes a familiar voice from somewhere.\n\nYou bolt upright.\n\n'&lt;&lt;print $nom&gt;&gt;!?' you hear Sasha's voice again. 'Are you there!?'\n\n'Oh fuck me!' you gasp.\n\n'I might need a minute.' Mr Green tells you breathlessly.\n\nYou scrabble to your feet and find your legs so weak and shaky that they're barely functional.\n\nWhat feels like half a pint of warm semen slides out of your gaping boy cunt, down your thighs and onto the grass. 'I'm coming!' you call out to her, hoping she thinks you're in your garden.\n\n'I have to go now.' you tell Mr Green, who simply waves casually and cracks a smile of satisfaction.\n\n'Where are you!?' comes Sasha's voice again, closer now. 'Did you fall asleep in the garden!?'\n\n'No! Sorry, I'm coming!' you call to her.\n\nYou exit out of Mr Green's back gate and see Sasha trying to look over your garden fence.\n\n'I'm here Sasha.' you tell her.\n\nShe looks over. 'Where were - ' she cuts herself off after seeing you. 'Oh...well you're not &lt;&lt;print $nom&gt;&gt; are you?\n\nHi &lt;&lt;print $fnom&gt;&gt;, what on Earth happened to you?\n\n...never mind.' she continues before you can think up something to explain how dishevelled you look and why you're in your uniform. 'We need to get you to the Mall for a bit of shopping before tonight. Have you eaten?'\n\n'Umm...kinda.' you reply.\n\n'What was that?' Sasha says, hushing you.\n\nYou shrug dishonestly.\n\n'It sounded like someone sniggering.' she says, listening. After another moment she shrugs. 'Never mind. How soon can you be ready Sugar?'\n\nYou hazard a guess. '[[Twenty minutes?|you decide]]'\n\n&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;/%back nt%/You get down off the chair and go through the back gate.

He seems to notice and looks at you strangely. 'That's okay &lt;&lt;print $fnom&gt;&gt;, you can tell me anything.'\n\nOddly enough, you feel as though you could and that terrifies you all the more.

He turns his back on you and you can’t help but be drawn by the sight of his tight ass thrusting as he fucks Charlie.\n\nYou look up and see her face, mouth open in breathless ecstasy. She opens her eyes, blindly gazing into space before noticing you.

Her pussy juice gushes over him and soaks the floor. You lick your lips, imagining how it might taste.\n\nHe lets her fall back toward the sofa while maintaining his hold of her ass and hips. He fucks her like that for a while with her torso dangling like a rag doll before letting her slide from his grasp.\n\nApparently he’s not done though and he splays her legs wide to expose her dripping cunt.

'Are you still gonna be my little play pet then?' she asks you seductively.\n\nYou nod.\n\nShe leads you into a cubicle, sits and starts pissing right in front of you. 'Tell me.'\n\n'Yes Charlie.' You tell her.\n\nCharlie pauses for a moment. 'I think... 'Mistress.' she decides.\n\n'Yes Mistress.' you confirm. Inside, you're all full of butterflies.

You put your mouth against her labia and feed on her slit diligently.\n\n'Good, now put your hands on the seat and show me your bum like a good girl.' she says, getting up.\n\n'Yes Mistress.'\n\nYou do as you're told and she flushes the toilet with the heel of her shoe.\n\n&lt;img src=&quot;Sleep_img/acc/bpg1.jpg&quot;&gt;\n\n'Good.

'For fucks sake Charlie! Subtle.'\n\n'It's not frickin bomb Aiya.' Charlie says, setting it on the table she's betting it in a poker game.\n\n'I've got one at home that kinda looks like one.' Bibi offers.\n\nAiya looks at her with seriousness. 'Maybe it'll go off while it's buried in your ass. You might even feel something.'\n\n'Aiya, I feel a pain in my ass right now.' Bibi retorts.\n\nFits of laughter erupt around the table.\n\n'Oh shit Aiya!' Sasha cackles. 'Did you just get rinsed by Bibi!?'\n\nThe conversation moves on and it's nearly time for the third and last period of the day.\n\n'Are you just going to leave that on the table Charlie?' Sasha asks her.\n\n'Oh, give it here.' you say, swiping it into your hand and walking off to the ladies.\n\nYou return shortly after as lunch break finishes and the girls cheer you on your return.\n\nThe five of you head up for [[last period]].\n&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n\n</div><div tiddler="you respond" tags="" created="201710071245" modifier="twee" twine-position="4630,1690">&lt;&lt;if $mumslife is &quot;‘Oh...that’s good then.’&quot;&gt;&gt;Your mother senses your unease.\n\n'Anyway, it's early days at the minute, I doubt anything will come of it.' she tells you, biting her lower lip.

That would have been included in your medical when you got here.\nAs for conventional methods such as hormones, blockers and surgery: Where on the Mainland, it might take a person years before their plea to transition is approved, here it's much easier - partly thanks to the employment of the Kline Process and partly because the Peninsulan Government doesn't like to make laws restricting what people do with their own bodies. We're nearing the end of trials for the general feminising treatment and once it's on the market, it will completely replace the established methods which tend to be expensive and or risky and or rather brutal.\n\nIf you'd be happy to answer a few extra questions, that would help our studies greatly.'\n\nYou tell him that's fine. After a few innocuous questions, he starts asking you questions about your sexuality and masturbation habits, stating 'although this has nothing to do with gender, we're interested to know if the process has any side effects on the subject's mentality.'\n\nYou spend the next few minutes lying through your teeth.\n\n'I see.'

You can tell he doesn't believe a word.\n\nHe continues anyway without pressing you further and outlines the pre-process requirements.\n\n'The Pre-Process Requirements (PPR)\nThe subject will be medically and psychologically examined and evaluated.\n\nConsultation and conference - (that's what this is)\n\nWe'll then go on a little tour of the facility - that's not part of it but hopefully it will be fun and interesting for you.\n\nNext - Signing the paperwork!\n\nFinally, you'll be ready for the process itself, provided we received an approval from the medical Doctor and Psychoanalyst of course.\n\nAs for the process itself:\n\nPhase 1\nImmersion Trial - Dr Brae has formulated a special breathable liquid which serves to introduce serums.\nThe subject will be immersed in a special tank for a brief duration where they can acclimatise to the new sensation.\n\nPhase 2\nImmersion.\n\nPhase 3\nSerums will be introduced which alter the subjects perception of sensation - think of these as anaesthetics.\n\nA further serum will give the subjects tissue more elasticity.
