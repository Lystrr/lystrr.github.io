// Begin Inventory Macros
// Original macros by F2Andy: http://strugglingwithtwine.blogspot.ca/2014/03/handling-inventory.html
//
// Instructions:
//
// 1. In a passage, check if there's an item in the inventory...
// ...if not, give the user the option to link to a passage that adds it to inventory:
// <<if $inventory.indexOf("An Unsigned Note") == -1>>There is a note here. [[Pick up the note.]]<<endif>>
//
// 2. In a passage, check if there's an item in the inventory..
// ...if so, give the user a choice to progress to a new passage:
// <<if $inventory.indexOf("The Golden Key") != -1>>[[Unlock the door.]]<<endif>>
//
// 3. To add an "Inventory" link in your sidebar menu, create a passage named "StoryMenu".
// In it, create a link to your inventory's passage: [[Inventory]] or [[Backpack]], for example.
// Create a passage named "Inventory", and in it, write something like the following:
// <<if $inventory.length == 0>>You are not carrying anything.<<else>>You are carrying:
// <<invWithLinks>> <<endif>>
// <<back>>

// A helper function for the following macros.

You &#39;&#39;have to&#39;&#39; use an item in the way its description says. If you don&#39;t, we will gladly give you a portion of@@ @@.jacky;Jacky&#39;s@@ @@.chef;medicine. I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t want that, right?

So, as I said, use the chosen item as instructed. You are not allowed to leave those designated areas unless one item is used. The items are on a first come, first served basis. This means that the first person to reach the room is allowed to choose the first item. If said item was used and remains in the room due its nature, others are &#39;&#39;not&#39;&#39; allowed to interact with it. You will see a list of all the items still available on monitors near the items. 

Some items will help you over the course of the parcour, others will hinder you. Be well to remember that not all effects are immediate though. Choose wisely. Just because you come first does not have to mean that you choose the best item!

Finally, the two most important rules: While the paths intersect for the items and the areas give you a chance to talk, you are &#39;&#39;not&#39;&#39; allowed to leave your designated path. Do not continue the parcour on another path than the one you start out on! You are allowed to talk though, so... go ahead, I guess! We love to see our participants discuss and enjoy themselves!
Secondly, should you fail the parcour at any point, you are considered to have lost and will be dealt with in an appropriate manner. Let&#39;s just say that for your own sake you do not want to fail at any point. On the other hand, I&#39;m sure a lot of people here would really love to see that happening! Am I right, everyone?&quot;@@

The crowd only cheers and you have no idea what to make out of this information-dump. You take a look at both @@.sarah;Sarah@@ and @@.cinthia;Cinthia@@ who clearly are similarly overwhelmed by the situation. Before any of you can even acknowledge each other further, you hear @@.jacky;Jacky@@ starting to shout again.

@@.jacky;&quot;Let me out of here for fucks sake! Please! I am sorry if I did anything wrong. I was only supposed to bring over the game, right? Why are you doin-&quot;@@

@@.jacky;Jacky&#39;s@@ words get caught up as another fog of pink engulfs her. The fog disappeares near instantly again this time. @@.jacky;Jacky@@ is now sporting two small breasts on her earlier masculine upper body! She just shrieks and [[looks up in fear.|parcourstart]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="parcourstart" tags="" position="833,880" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;set $player.underwear = &quot;naked&quot;&gt;&gt;\
As @@.jacky;Jacky@@ got transformed further, the value next to her name on the monitor changed. @@.player;The figure went lower?@@, you think.

@@.chef;&quot;Right, I knew I forgot something. Anyone who fails the parcour will be sold off as a slave. Those values are the biddings and assumed chances you are put at by our fantastic audiences. It influences your price at the end, so there&#39;s nothing to worry about if you don&#39;t fail! If your points are high enough, you might get a few items here and there though, so you might want to keep them high. Especially by stopping to whine about how ungrateful we are. If you win you obviously will be returned. You can work out the rest by yourselves. This already took too long in my opinion - let the games begin and &#39;&#39;//good luck//&#39;&#39;!&quot;@@

As his voice quieted down and the crowd started cheering, a timer appeared on the monitor, counting down from 10. With a loud rattling of different mechanisms the floor around you starts to sink down, but not the cubes and different elements of the parcour.

You start to panic. What the hell are you supposed to do? Some guy got breasts and probably his genitalia removed. How is this even possible!? You do not even know where you are. What can you do to escape? Is your only chance for leaving to &quot;win&quot; this race? How are you supposed to have a winning strategy if you don&#39;t even know anything about what is to come?

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;The timer reaches 8.&lt;/div&gt;

As the moving floor reaches its lowest point, a few metres below you, water seems to be flowing in from the sidewalls that were created through the down-movement of the floor. The audience cheers as the floor begins to fill.

You do not have time for this. You have to think, fast. You could talk to @@.sarah;Sarah@@ who was calling out to you earlier, but then you remember @@.cinthia;Cinthia@@ and her desastrous state. What about the path you are supposed to succeed on?

It&#39;s actually not a path, but moving platforms on the left and right side each. They quickly change positions in a consistant pattern, moving towards and away from your position. There are multiple platforms each on the sides and the platforms coincidentally move so that a jump from the left to the right side, and vice versa, should work out without problems. You are not sure if you could risk a jump from one of the side platforms to the following platform of the same side, as the distance might be too large.

In the corner of your eyes you spot that the platforms of both @@.sarah;Sarahs@@ and @@.cinthia;Cinthias@@ course slightly differentiate from yours. So, depending on ones startpositions and willingless to start, one might actually get the jump earlier than others. 
@@.player;&quot;This shithole of a place is rigged&quot;@@ is the only thing you can think of. With the speed of the platforms you can deduce that you should be able to jump immediately if you jump out and at worst catch the edge to hold onto, which seems entirely doable.

It is not long before one of them takes out their dick, you can only guess through a opening in the suit, and rams it inside her pussy without warning. Where you thought to hear a pain ridden scream, only the most blissful, orgasmic moan reaches your ears. It did not even take a second after the first insertion for her to swing her arms around him and push her tongue down his throat, eagerly entangling her tongue with his&#39;. He continued pumping his rock-hard rod into her pussy and the other men slowly supported both of them towards the edge of the arena where they probably could be pulled out. Next to the crowd&#39;s cheering you were only able to make out muffled, tongue-loving moans every other second. Scared and disgusted, not sure which feeling was more overwhelming, you turned around and made your way towards the button.

You pick up the VR Headset. A light flickers to your left, where a grey chair becomes visible. As you make your way towards it, @@.sarah;Sarah@@, who has just come in, calls after you.
@@.sarah;&quot;Make sure to be safe, $player.playerName!&quot;@@
&lt;&lt;if $r1.c_fall eq true&gt;&gt;@@.sarah;&quot;I saw @@@@.cinthia;Cinthia@@@@.sarah; fall down and... I...&quot;@@ She suddenly starts to puke.
@@.player;&quot;@@@@.sarah;Sarah@@@@.player;... I know how you feel, but right now we have to survive this clusterfuck and get out of here. Try to suppress the image of her, hard as it might be. We can only hope the best for her... I wouldn&#39;t know what to do if you fell down there too. Stay with me. Please.&quot;@@
Your genuine words have her collect her thoughts. She just nods at you. @@.sarah;&quot;You are right. I&#39;m sorry. Those creeps won&#39;t get any show from me.&quot;@@ She smiles at you. @@.sarah;&quot;Thanks. Let&#39;s do this, $player.playerName!&quot;@@

You nod, place your VR Headset on top of the the chair and get into it. As told by the instructions you place your neck firmly against its designated spot and do the same with your wrists and legs. Within a second of pressing your last missing leg into its position, metallic looking shackles lock your wrists and legs into place, while a collar springs out and forces it around your neck, pressing it back into place with a bothersome, but not painful, force. @@.player;&quot;Fuck-&quot;@@ you manage to get out in shock of the sudden changes, before the VR Headset gets moved onto your face, engulfing your upper face completely. You can hear @@.sarah;Sarah@@ shout out to you in surprise and horror, before the screen in front of your eyes begins flickering.

&lt;span class=&quot;glitchy&quot; data-text=&quot;You see numerous pictures of women sucking cock and pleasing their masters in rapid succession.&quot;&gt;You see numerous pictures of women sucking cock and pleasing their masters in rapid succession.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;drunk&quot; style=&quot;color:HotPink&quot;&gt;You feel like you are in pure ecstasy.&lt;/span&gt;
Ultimately they become short movieclips with the women slurping along the shaft. You are then presented with a collection of cumshots and the women&#39;s happy faces.
&lt;span class=&quot;glitchy&quot; data-text=&quot;Yummy&quot;&gt;Disgusting&lt;/span&gt;

The content shifts towards a large wall made of holes with cocks coming out of them, and another &lt;span class=&quot;drunk&quot; style=&quot;color:HotPink&quot;&gt;lucky&lt;/span&gt; contestant trying to climb it. The contestant does so with ease by blowing a cock and servicing two others with their hands while doing so. As they get hard, they start to climb on top of the hard dicks and hurry along, before they start to lose their hardness. &lt;span class=&quot;drunk&quot; style=&quot;color:HotPink&quot;&gt;So many beautiful cocks.&lt;/span&gt;

The screen suddenly turns off and the headset is forcibly removed from your head. A large amount of spit is hanging from your mouth&#39;s edge and your penis is erect, your cum plastered on the floor all around you. The room is empty. Either noone came in after @@.sarah;Sarah@@ or you are likely to be in last position.

&lt;span class=&quot;drunk&quot; style=&quot;color:HotPink&quot;&gt;&quot;I can definitely make up the distance at the yummy wall!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, you think to yourself before touching your head. 
@@.player;&quot;What the fuck?&quot;@@ you speak out loud. Your head does not hurt, but you did not really think that right now, right? Right? To your luck a new door appears in the darkness, which seems to be for you. Shaking your head you decide to press on. If you are last, you have to catch up!

You pick up the Shampoo-tube. A light flickers to your right, making visible a small showerstand on a small, grey floor. &lt;&lt;if $r1.j_place eq $r1.p_place+1&gt;&gt;@@.jacky;Jacky@@ pushes you to the side with the shampoo in hand and looks at the list herself. @@.jacky;&quot;What crap is this?&quot;@@ you hear her ask as you go towards the shower. &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

You have a look at the shampoo, but despite it being pink there is nothing out of the ordinary. Well, except there being no ingredients listed. It is not even named. Actually, that does seem quite out of the world of ordinary. You can only imagine what is in there&lt;&lt;if $r1.c_fall eq false&gt;&gt;.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;, especially after seeing what happened to @@.cinthia;Cinthia@@. You feel unwell thinking about it&lt;&lt;if $r1.p_place eq 1&gt;&gt;, but you have to press on.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;, but seeing @@.sarah;Sarah@@ in that chair and not backing down is the thing that let&#39;s you keep going.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

You step into the shower and halfheartedly turn a knob in front of you. Warm water immediately starts to sprout from the showerhead atop of you. To your surprise this seems like totally normal water. You stand there for a few seconds, prepared for the worst to happen, but nothing. It&#39;s getting steamy around you, blocking your view from what&#39;s happening. You look at the shampoo in your hands. You ponder it for a moment, but just think @@.player;&quot;//Screw it,//&quot;@@ before you unbottle it. You press on the small tube until its contents are fully on your hand and start applying it to your head. And then you scrub.

And you scrub.

&lt;span class=&quot;drunk&quot; style=&quot;color:HotPink&quot;&gt;Scrubby scrub.&lt;/span&gt;

And you scrub even more.

When did you even start? &lt;span class=&quot;drunk&quot; style=&quot;color:HotPink&quot;&gt;Scrub.&lt;/span&gt;

This water trickling down your skin makes you feel kind of good actually, now that you think about it. This shower is a pretty relaxing experience, compared to the aforeseen horrors. You feel like you don&#39;t want to take a step out of this shower. &lt;span class=&quot;drunk&quot; style=&quot;color:HotPink&quot;&gt;Scrub.&lt;/span&gt;

You remember the instructions well. To wash your head until the shampoo is clearly gone, right? Even so, the created foam through scrubbing only seems to increase in quantity. How are you supposed to wash your &lt;span class=&quot;drunk&quot; style=&quot;color:HotPink&quot;&gt;long, blonde&lt;/span&gt; hair anyways with such a small tube? @@.player2;&quot;//They must not have thought about this very well,//&quot;@@ you think to yourself, continuing to scrub your long hair. You @@.player2;giggle@@ when something tickles your asscheecks and you look back, only to see that it was your hair. @@.player2;&quot;Jeez, this always happens. So bothersome...&quot;@@

Just then, the foam seems to have been washed away. The water coincidentally stops flowing too, even though you didn&#39;t touch the knob. You can only assume that this is the sign for you to continue with the parcour.

As the steam dissipates, you can see how @@.sarah;Sarah@@ is still in the chair. You can clearly see glistening wetness dropping down from her private parts, down the chair, into a small puddle so-to-say. Your face flushes thinking about how good she must be feeling. You shake your head - @@.player;&quot;What am I thinking...?&quot;@@ Whatever was in that shampoo, this must be part of its effects. This is nothing to be aroused by, this is horror! To your luck a new door appears in the darkness, which seems to be for you.

&lt;&lt;if $r1.c_fall eq true&gt;&gt;\
	@@.jacky;Jacky@@ stands near the monitor and seems to be applying some lipstick, completely ignoring you. You only feel distaste towards that girl and decide to [[continue on.|r2start]]\
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	@@.jacky;Jacky@@ sits on top of the item-chest and is focused on applying the nail polish. @@.cinthia;Cinthia@@ seems to have left already and you [[intend to do the same.|r2start]]

You pick up the Lipstick. &lt;&lt;if $r1.j_place eq $r1.p_place+1&gt;&gt;@@.jacky;Jacky@@ pushes you to the side, shampoo in hand, and looks at the list herself. @@.jacky;&quot;What crap is this?&quot;@@ you hear her ask. &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Nothing else happens.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; You go off to the side. 

You inspect the lipstick, but it seems perfectly normal. There is no mirror or anything, so you guess you have to improvise. How do you use that stuff correctly without smearing anyways? &lt;&lt;if $r1.c_fall eq true&gt;&gt;You sigh. Even though you try to lift your spirit with these kind of questions, your stomach drops at the smallest thought of @@.cinthia;Cinthia@@. You just can&#39;t shake off the fears of what those bastards might be doing to her right now. And with the effect of the water out there, you are even more afraid of what is possible to happen in here.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

With a questioning look at the lipstick, you open it and start applying it to your lips. As the instructions said you try to spread it out evenly. The content seems to dissolve pretty fast on your lips as the lipstick gets shorter with every secon-

You moan excessively through your &lt;span class=&quot;drunk&quot; style=&quot;color:HotPink&quot;&gt;large, puffy&lt;/span&gt; lips while trying your best to not fall down because of your weakening knees. Your body gives in though and you fall forward on your knees, face slightly above ground. You pant heavily and see your own cum stains in front of you. You instinctively lick your lips, bringing straight up another orgasm. You roll back your eyes as you moan even loader because of your newfound sensitivity, shaking in horror and bliss at the same time. As you gather your thoughts anew, you immediately jump up and turn around. 
						&lt;span class=&quot;drunk&quot; style=&quot;color:HotPink&quot;&gt;Cum&lt;/span&gt; is echoing all throughout your head, giving you an impulsive need to just taste what is there already. You hold your head with both hands in shock. @@.player;&quot;Fuck this shit&quot;@@ you manage to scream, forcing yourself to walk away meekly. While you do manage to do so, you also can&#39;t get the potential taste of cum out of your head. Your tongue once again escapes your mouth and licks over your lips, letting you moan in ecstasy and leaving you a panting wreck of happiness. As you force yourself away even further, a new door becomes visible. You think how this must be yours, and as you go towards it you check the room one last time. Only @@.sarah;Sarah@@ is still confined to her chair. [[You need to catch up!|r2start]]

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;
You ponder the nail polish for a bit and ultimately decide to use it. As you open it, the smell of the nail enamel hits you. @@.player;&quot;Kind of sweet, actually.&quot;@@ You take the small brush and start to use it on your fingernails. Upon first contact your hand starts to prickle, but nevertheless you press on. Whatever is happening out there, it can&#39;t be as bad as what some sort of nail polish might do. With every stroke the prickling gets stronger, but nothing else happens.

As you have finished your hands, you start with your feet. As your feet start to tingle, @@.jacky;Jacky@@ leaves the shower. Her hair flows down to her ass, gleaming in the most clear blonde you have ever seen on a woman. She catches you watching her and winks, giggling afterwards. @@.jacky;&quot;You might want to be careful with those claws, kitty.&quot;@@ She purrs at you, before leaving towards a door that lit up inbetween your staring and her reaction. You wonder what she meant with claws and look at your fingernails again. You are taken aback - You are sprouting some pink and long fake nails! As you try to take them off you realize that they actually are real. You shudder. You are sure that any sporty climbing won&#39;t be going well with these things. &lt;&lt;if $r1.wentleft eq false || $r1.alternate eq false&gt;&gt;Especially something like catching the edge of a moving platform as in the parcour just now.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

As you finish with your feet, the tingling subsides. Surprisingly nothing more happens, except you having &lt;span class=&quot;drunk&quot; style=&quot;color:HotPink&quot;&gt;glorious&lt;/span&gt; pink toenails. Now that you think about it, &lt;span class=&quot;drunk&quot; style=&quot;color:HotPink&quot;&gt;pink&lt;/span&gt; is kinda&#39; beautiful, isn&#39;t it? Gee.

It has been some time since @@.jacky;Jacky@@ left, so you decide to go after her. You look back at @@.sarah;Sarah@@ and see how she is still confined to her chair&lt;&lt;if $r1.c_fall eq true&gt;&gt;.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;, and @@.cinthia;Cinthia@@ not moving, standing still. You can only assume this to be part of the effects of the items.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Thus, you decide to carry on and catch up with @@.jacky;Jacky@@ before she potentially gets a too big of a headstart on all of you. Who knows what the parcour still has in order? What if contestants get the chance to manipulate others? No need to risk that. With that you make yourself on the way, as a door conventiely started to light up. Must be yours?

As you open it and walk through, you can hear an ecstatic moan from @@.cinthia;Cinthia@@, but before you can react [[the door closes behind you, shutting off all sound.|r2start]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="47" name="r2start" tags="" position="1412,2494" size="100,100">You are in some sort of hallway, only a few dozen steps long. All the edges are glowing slightly pink with pitch black surfaces. Through its pink outlines you are able to identify a door at the end of the darkness.

As you step towards it, fog bursts out along the edges of the room. This reminds you of what happened to @@.jacky;Jacky@@ before the start of the parcour. Your stomach dropped. You really only see two choices here - Reach the end of the hallway as fast as you can, or scream for someone to hear you. You did not break any rules or similar, did you? Why would this happen!?

Within a few moments, a light in the purposedly middle of the room starts to flicker. There&#39;s only a table with a PC and monitor on it. You are alone in this room. You are not sure how this would be a race if everyone would take turns at the PC, whatever the task. You assume there have to be other rooms with a similar setup.

You carefully approach the table, only your footsteps echoing throughout the room. The PCs monitor is turned away from you and behind the table is a chair. You take one cautious step after another, but there is only silence. Not knowing what to do, except interacting somehow with this place, you sit down in the chair. As if it was an reaction to that, the Monitor crackles and starts up. You see some flickering out of the corner of your right eye and as you look towards its source, you can see a window in the shape of a circle with fish swimming behind.

A sudden beep brings your attention back to its origin, the Monitor. A program seems to have started itself up, showing you a screen with a question and multiple answers. You are offered buttons to click with the mouse on the table. This must be a quiz.

As you open it, light starts to shine into the hallway. You can also hear the crowd cheering again. You push open the door even more to find that you are back in the big hall again, together with all of the audience and contestants. You start to look around to see what you can find. On the left lane you can see a white girl with long, black hair pushing forward on a bicycle. As you inspect her closer, you can see that the seat consists of two dildos which take turns pushing into one of her holes. She is eagerly sucking on another dildo in front of her face, while her arms and feet are strapped to the front wheels. Everytime she seems to complete the motion of a blowjob, the wheel in the back starts to turn a bit and the bicycle moves forward, while the dildos that plough her holes alternate. You want to look even closer, getting unwittingly wet at the prospect of this challenge, only to be interrupted by the announcer.

	The bike suddenly comes to a halt, though you only realize that because no more @@.player2;yummy@@ substance is provided for your mouth. As you slowly snap back into reality, face not changing as you continue to suck, you have your body get back up from the vibrating back dildos. As your lower holes leave them behind, a sudden spurt of @@.player2;tasty stuff@@ shoots into your mouth and you orgasm on the spot. Actually, the substance keeps coming and you drink and drink, trying to drink as much of it as possible. As your mouth gets fuller, parts of the substance start escaping your mouth, running down your chin. 
	But then, suddenly, the flow stops. At this point you are so focused on sucking and in &lt;span class=&quot;drunk&quot; style=&quot;color:HotPink&quot;&gt;such need&lt;/span&gt; for this stuff that you try moving both pussy and asshole back onto their dildos immediately. But they are gone. Just then, the dildo in your mouth seems to be retracting into the bike. Shocked you try to suck harder once again. By now standing up, you join your hands and try to play with your tongue along it. But it keeps retracting until it finally disappears in the bike. You avidly lick around the place of its disappearance, but are met with nothing.
	It takes a few moments of torturing unconclusive results, but you finally snap back. Your face instantly turns red as you realize the cheering of the crowd, their gazes on you. You get off the bike as fast as you can and go towards the door on this platform&#39;s side. That doesn&#39;t stop you from [[subconsciously licking the remains off your chin as you move away from the bike.|r3bikefin][$r3.p_place=_steps]]

You are sucking the dildo enthusiastically. As you move your head up and down, spit already joined with most of the shaft providing you with a glorious slippery feel along the tongue, you taste a substance. Your tastebuds are met with the most delicious taste, making your skin crawl. You find out fast that the stronger you suck, the more of that substance leaves the dildo. As if instinct took over, you start taking as much of the dildo into your mouth as possible to provide as much suction as you can while sliding up again. As you are provided with streams of this @@.player2;yummy stuff@@, your mind goes blank. Your eyes can&#39;t focus anymore and roll back while you start pumping harder with the rest of the body. &lt;span class=&quot;drunk&quot; style=&quot;color:HotPink&quot;&gt;More...!&lt;/span&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="76" name="r3bike" tags="" position="2830,3542" size="100,100">The cheers of the audience feel stifling as you approach your challenge. At the edge of the platform you find a bike on a small lane that works as a bridge to another platform straight ahead, guiding the bike over another pit of water. Upon further inspection you are able to confirm what you already saw in action: Three pink dildos are mounted on top of it. One on the front handle, two on the seat. You know exactly what they are for. &lt;&lt;if $influence &gt;= 10&gt;&gt;@@.player2;&quot;Not that its too bad...&quot;@@ you think, slapping yourself in the face instantly to get rid of those thoughts. @@.player2;&quot;Goddamn, why are these thoughts so invasive.&quot;@@&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

As you inspect the other lanes, you can see the shape of @@.sarah;Sarah@@ and @@.jacky;Jacky@@. \
&lt;&lt;if $p_items.includes(&quot;vr&quot;)&gt;&gt;\
	The former is ahead in the race, but the latter is catching up. You don&#39;t feel like there is a chance to catch up to @@.sarah;Sarah@@, but @@.jacky;Jacky@@ should still be in reach if you give it your all. \
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	The former is only slightly ahead and an easy catch, you think. The latter might need some harder work, but is entirely in the realm of possibility. \
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $r1.c_fall eq false&gt;&gt;\
	@@.cindy;Cindy@@ is currently preparing to mount the bike.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	The lane to your right is empty. Your eyes linger no longer than a few seconds before you have to turn away.@@.player2;&quot;//Focus...//&quot;@@, you force yourself to think.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
As you see the others work the bike, you accept the reality of what you have to do. You feel a slight wetness build up between your legs as you watch the girls suck on the dildo while thrusting their asses up and down, moaning uncontrollably throughout. Since you are so sensitive you can only expect the &lt;&lt;if $player.influence &gt;= 10&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;glitchy&quot; data-text=&quot;best.&quot; style=&quot;color:HotPink&quot;&gt;worst.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;worst.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

There is no way around it, though. It has to be done. You gulp one last time and force yourself onto the bike. You carefully step on it and bring yourself into position, dildo right before your eyes. The only thing that gives you relief, at least in the context of this situation, is that your wetness will help you reduce the pain of sticking those things inside you. You really are not out for a raw ass-pounding. As the front dildo dangles before you, you kind of start fixating on it. The audiences cheers are starting to drown out and your nipples harden instinctively. &lt;&lt;if $p_items.includes(&quot;ls&quot;)&gt;&gt;@@.player;&#39;&#39;Your mouth&#39;&#39; starts to slightly salivate and your lipstick covered lips subconsciously form an &quot;O&quot;, ready for the task at hand - or mouth.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; You throw one last glance at your competitors who work the bikes and see how a bike moved further along as they used their lower body parts. You are sure there is a correct way to get the most distance out of it.

@@.player2;Was it really night at the time?@@ &lt;span class=&quot;drunk&quot; style=&quot;color:HotPink&quot;&gt;It&#39;s clearly daytime here... !&lt;/span&gt;

You don&#39;t understand. She was an emotional wreck, and- Wait.

How are they able to show you this in the first place? Those are @@.player2;//your//@@ memories! They couldn&#39;t just access them like that, right? What else were they able to do !? What if-

That makes sense.

As you go through all those thoughts, you are sure that you just saw an image where @@.cindy;Cindy@@ masturbated on the swing! Was this for real? @@.player2;&quot;//Am I so horny that I am imagining things by now?//&quot;@@ you think quietly. But the thought of her masturbating doesn&#39;t leave your mind.

It would feel so &lt;span class=&quot;drunk&quot; style=&quot;color:HotPink&quot;&gt;right-&lt;/span&gt;

A sudden orgasms erupts from your body and you throw open your eyes. You realize that the headset has been removed and you were &#39;&#39;in fact&#39;&#39; touching yourself down there. Whatever was going on, @@.player2;at least you feel better now@@.

&lt;&lt;if $p_items_used.includes(&quot;injection&quot;)&gt;&gt;\

Hey everyone, thank you for playing!

This game features content intended for people aged 18+. By continuing you agree that you are of legal age. 

It was originally created for a small contest on [[TFGamesSite|https://tfgames.site/index.php?module=viewgame&amp;id=2193]]. It definitely wasn&#39;t good enough at that point, but I was happy with what I created in the few days that were left until the deadline. I really like the concept and want to expand on it. Depending on interest I might give this project a higher priority, as life doesn&#39;t fail to keep me busy.

I also created a [[Discord Server|https://discord.com/invite/xDasJRD]] if you want to chat, have suggestions or feedback and prefer that way of communication.

The current version is &#39;&#39;0.41&#39;&#39;. Refer to the [[Changelog|changelog]] for details.

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;This update includes a hover function for the pictures. If you don&#39;t like the implementation, you can deactivate it in the Settings menu. I hope to improve it for the next version.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

If you enjoy the game, please refer to the [[Patreon|Patreon]] section. Have fun!

&lt;/ul&gt;

Few things matter anymore. One of those things that matter is that juicy cock in your mouth. It belongs to some guy whose name you have forgotten as soon as it entered your face-hole. After all, there is no need to remember the old, boring stuff.

It has been an hour now. The guy left already, some of his cum still lingering in parts of your mouth. You don&#39;t feel like wasting it during the long waits. You also don&#39;t have much to do. Except waiting. And you hate waiting. Your eyes are fixated on the pink, locked door. You love pink. Seeing pink makes you all giggly. Waiting is hard, but the door being pink makes it all okay. As if all worries just vanish. 

You gasp and jump off your bed, your new oversized melons swinging with you. A new customer entered! You gulp down the last bit of cum and start rubbing your nipples happily. You learned that this is something that always works. Instant hard-ons. And who doesn&#39;t love those, right? Your waiting period is all but forgotten, some penis stretching your vagina and your moans echoing in the room.

You feel like you have forgotten something. Or someone. Something that once was important. As you grab your sheets, nearing climax, your heart feels heavy. You don&#39;t know why, though. Everything is pink! The door, the walls, even those bed sheets you are grabbing onto. You love pink. Seeing pink makes you all giggly! Nevertheless, a tear runs down your cheek. You feel the thrusts getting heavier, your brain giving in a tad more. Something is wrong, you think. Something is not right. You hear the guy moaning and thrusting one final time, and you realize what the issue is. Of course. You turn around and look at him. You smile. Grabbing his dick, you taste some of his delicious cum, making you feel warm again. There is no need to remember the old, boring stuff, right?

All with the risk of it being day-time and being spotted by passersby.

As if your wish has been granted, you seem to have switched places with the girl. You are sucking him! You tremble on the feelings of your lips brushing along his shaft. Your tongue circling his glans. Your eyes look up at him and you get the only reward you need in that moment - @@.player2;Approval@@. You want to savor the moment, but as he grabs your head you fully understand what he expects of you. You increase your speed, bobbing along the shaft faster and harder. Whenever his juicy dick hits the back of your throat, small moans escape your lips. This in turn makes his dick twitch, resulting in your throbbing pussy needing more attention. But you can&#39;t! You need to get him off. You want to get him off. And you know you will achieve that, right in this moment. He grabs your hair, your skin crawling from the sensation. He gets a tight hold and forces you down on his cock, your nose connecting with his hairless base. His intoxicating, sweaty smell goes up your nostrils. Your pussy gushes with love juice, your nipples need to be touched, anything- Anything to get you over that last edge. And then he grunts. He grunts and commands you. Commands you to cum. And that you do. Your eyes flip back into your head, your moan wholeheartedly coming out with never before felt intensity. Your pussy throbbs and throbbs, sending one spike of happiness after the other directly to your brain. As if that was not enough, he grunts one final time and unloads his sperm right into your throat. You don&#39;t have time to be sad about not having the possibility to taste it. You feel so happy about feeling it run down your body. &lt;&lt;if $p_traits.includes(&quot;submissive&quot;)&gt;&gt;You are indeed a @@.player2;good girl@@.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Time seems to go by, but none of it matters. You are in bliss. His cock is still in your mouth, but its of no concern to you. You breath nonetheless.

The usual darkness welcomes you as you enter the room. Seconds go by before the light starts to flicker. A ray shines from down from above, highlighting a rectangular container of sorts on some cylindric shaped podium.

You walk towards it, knowing it is expected of you, and inspect it. It&#39;s empty! Confused, you look around. You look below for any clue. Nothing. That is until another light flickers and you can see a pink tube coming out of the wall. 

Curious and afraid you give it a small touch, it being placed on the same height as your hips. But once again, nothing happens. Next to the tube on the wall a small, pink neon-color font appears, saying &quot;bad girl&quot;. Below the font, you see a two-frame animation of a girl in front of the tube and the girl having it in her mouth. You recollect how your //sponsor// said on you having to fill a container. You are pretty sure whatever is coming out of the tube has to be transported to the container. Naturally, perverted as this place is, the only allowed method to transport this with might be with the help of your mouth!
&lt;&lt;if $p_traits.includes(&quot;oralfixation&quot;)&gt;&gt;\
	@@.player2;Your eyes kind of lock onto the tube, as you lick your lips. It&#39;s not like sucking something... or someone... off is, like, a bad thing, right?@@

&lt;&lt;if $p_traits.includes(&quot;submissive&quot;)&gt;&gt;\
	@@.player2;Nevermind that - They called you a bad girl! You are a good girl and you will demonstrate that just so. You are sure they will shower you with praise afterwards. Like the good girl you are.@@
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

You squat as comfortably as possible to level your face with the tube. Careful and slow you put your lips around the tip of the tube. It feels like some cold plastic, though the pink font on the wall changed to &quot;good girl&quot;. &lt;&lt;if $p_traits.includes(&quot;submissive&quot;)&gt;&gt;@@.player2;You get wet instantly. @@&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; You try to suck a bit, at a loss on what to do, but once again, nothing happens. You are greeted with a new two-frame animation, showing the girl deepthroating the tube. You look down at the rest of its shaft that isn&#39;t behind your lips already. It does not protrude too far out of the wall; The length of a strong mans&#39; hands maybe? 

You try to...
[[Exhale and relax your face and throat to slide it in.|r7_relax][$player.points += (50*$player.pointmod)]]

You relax your face, cheeks sinking and eyes closing slightly. Your mouth relaxes around the pink tube and as if by itself, the tube slides in just a tiny bit. Without much force you slowly go forwards, the wall-cock grinding along the top of your tongue. Without any troubles, you reach the end of the tube. It&#39;s not as bad as you would have guessed, though the feeling is definitely uncomfortable; Like something is stuck in your throat! @@.player2;//Gee~//@@

The pink neon text changes to &quot;Good girl!&quot;, which makes you &lt;&lt;if $p_traits.includes(&quot;submissive&quot;)&gt;&gt;@@.player2;smile dreamily. //They are praising you!@@ //&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;roll your eyes.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

You suddenly feel something amassing in the back of your throat. You are neither able to taste or really feel it. Something is just there. The tube must be letting out some fluid! //@@.player2;&quot;Of course it is,&quot;@@// you think. But that makes your goal clear: Fill that container with the tubes fluid! 

But how are you supposed to be doing that? If the fluid comes out while deepthroating the tube, its going to run down your throat until you swallow it. If you don&#39;t, you will have to fight the urge to puke&lt;&lt;if $r7.puke eq true&gt;&gt; once again&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;.

Some voice speaks up in your head: &lt;span class=&quot;drunk&quot; style=&quot;color:HotPink&quot;&gt;@@.player2;Slide back and store it in your, like, cheeks, dummy!@@&lt;/span&gt;
Yeah, that makes sense, doesn&#39;t it? Of course. Sometimes you really are quite the @@.player2;dummy@@.

Having your @@.player2;sensitive lips@@ move among the base of the tube sends a chill down your spine. It was only a moment, but it hit all the right nerves. You moan loudly into the tube, your muffled voice echoing throughout the dark, empty room. But you don&#39;t have the time to stop and enjoy this, so you continue. 
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
As you do this, you inevitably taste it. It is... cum!

Before you can react otherwise, you gulped down the first load already. And then the next.
	A vacant smile plasters your face. Muffled moans and gulps echo throughout the empty room.
	You are not sure how much time has passed by the time your hunger was sated, but the puddle below you indicates quite a lot. The neon-pink text only has @@.player2;&quot;Cum Whore&quot;@@ written on it, which makes you blush. &lt;&lt;if $p_traits.includes(&quot;submissive&quot;) or $p_traits.includes(&quot;kindahappy&quot;)&gt;&gt;@@.player2;Being reminded that they watch and evaluate you makes you sort of happy.@@&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; &quot;//This is not me,//&quot; you think in horror.

You are @@.player2;fixated@@ on the perfect execution of your moves. All the things you can learn! There is nothing better than @@.player2;Oral@@, you feel. 
	You start touching yourself as you lick along the tube, taking in the wonderful feeling of accomplishment with cum flooding your throat. Soon your mouth starts to overflow, cum oozing out between your lips. Even so, your priority lies with the tube and the licking it deserves. The one you deserve. Thoughts of real cocks, of nipples, of wet pussies and assholes intrude your mind. You hungrily moan into the tube once again, rubbing your attention seeking clit. Your moan allows the cum saved in your expanded cheeks to escape, running down your chin. But it matters not, for licking the tube is of more importance. And thus the time goes by, lost cum mixing with a puddle of wetness below you.
	It is only when you feel like you can deepthroat exceptionally well that you stop focusing the tube. Feelings of guilt proudness and guilt wash over you at the same time, where in the back of your head the urgency of filling the container starts to take over.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	You face the reality: This isn&#39;t the first time you have to deal with disgusting situations in this place. Though drinking cum sure is on another level. Even so, you have the feeling that your old self would have reacted way harsher to this situation. You almost feel... okay with drinking this substance. Worry spreads, but at the same time the seeming acceptance of the situation puts you at ease again. You catch yourself thinking: @@.player2;&quot;//It&#39;s not &#39;&#39;that&#39;&#39; bad after all, right?//&quot;@@
	And indeed, it might not be that bad. Who knows if your old self would have liked it? Does it even matter? The taste in your current body is actually quite acceptable. They probably modified it in some way, but maybe once you get out of here you could entertain the idea of tasting it here and th-

&lt;&lt;if not $p_traits.includes(&quot;cumaddiction&quot;)&gt;&gt;With a full mouth you look back to the container.

That is, until you hit the back of your throat. With wide open eyes you jump back in horror, feeling your throat work on keeping your stomach at bay. You take some time to focus on your well-being before you are able to proceed.

This definitely was the wrong approach to the problem at hand... or at mouth?

Oh, how you have longed for it. How you have craved it. And here you are presented with a fountain of pure, delicious cum, waiting to be served to you.

	You press your mouth even harder against the tube, not feeling any pain. You eyes are drawn back, your pussy gushing constantly. Your whole body is tensing up, your nails scratching the wall in front of you desperate for more cum. Not that it would achieve anything. Not that it even makes sense - The tube is rewarding you with plenty. But behind that wall must be a supply waiting for you! And if not, it has to lead you towards it! Who cares about anything else at this point? All your cravings and wishes can be fulfilled. Your future is waiting behind that tube!
	
	In your haze, you have reached the wall with your lips while deepthroating. 
	In your desperation, your tongue tries to work around the tube while you swallow every new ounce of fluid. 
	In your bliss, any feeling of a full stomach is overridden by a constant wave of new orgasms.
	
	It is not long before your body collapses. Your mouth still on the tube, pussy continuously gushing, the inevitable arrives. Your overblown stomach reacts as could be expected and forces the swallowed cum back up.
	
	You are sucking happily on the tube, though. You have no recollection of anything that happened. By now, your face is in a small harness that stops you backing away from the tube. Not that you would want that in the first place. You are pretty sure something is being inserted into your lower parts right now. But who cares? Anything that matters is right in front of you.

Nothing.

Desperation settles in. Are you really supposed to repeat this for hours on end? You look back towards the tube. Back at the container. Back at the trail of wetness you left in-between them.

On your way back, a screen on the wall suddenly turns on with a bright pink tone and a familiar voice chimes in.

After struggling financially for some time, I am now at a point where I can continue with this. 

Even so, and I feel it is &#39;&#39;important&#39;&#39; to point out: I would like to create more renders. But my equipment is old and I don&#39;t have the financial backup to update at this moment. For every render I create, my PC is basically unusable for 2-24 hours depending on the content. This is especially noteworthy considering that there are not a lot of details in the renders (e.g. background), as my PC wouldn&#39;t be able to handle that.

Therefore, the point of the patreon page is to &#39;&#39;//support//&#39;&#39; me to get better equipment for better and faster renders. This in turn allows me to write more stuff, frees up more days I can actually do some render-work, and ultimately lets me create more detailed renders. 

In short, what does this mean?

- I will continue to work on this game regardless of your support, rest assured! I hope to pick up the pace soon, but I still have to finish dealing with my own 2020 problems.

- I originally planned to transition into two other projects of mine, but due to me not being able to create more detailed renders, those are going to be on-hold. This gives me more time to work on this game. Best case, I can upgrade my PC once I want to transition to my other projects.

- Your &#39;&#39;//support//&#39;&#39; helps speed things up. I am back to financial stability where I can slowly put money towards upgrades. This will take some time though, so every help is appreciated.

- Your Patreon &#39;&#39;//support//&#39;&#39; is also going to show me that I&#39;m on a good track with the writing and general quality. If I&#39;m honest, I am probably going to feel a bit more vindicated in doing the right thing if someone is willing to support me.

A door at the wall is highlighted, and like a moth to the flame, you start walking with ticket in hand.

It opens automatically as you close in, revealing a spiral staircase illuminated with dim, pink colors. It goes up, and so do you, step after step. Your naked feet touch its cold, unused metal, your hand sliding along its railing ever so careful.

You walk. And you walk. You wonder if there is place for doubts in your mind. Isn&#39;t you meeting with a sponsor exactly what they would want from you? Were you tricked into wasting time and entertaining them at the same time?
You shake your head. It is too late for doubts. Not like they weren&#39;t there before. Got to get this behind you. So... you walk. Step after step. 

What felt like an eternity came to a halt when you reached the top, entering another dim, pinkish room. The only difference is its pink parquet to give your feet some warmth and comfort.

He bows to you, inviting you in like it would be expected of a servant. The girl just smiles at you with a vacant look on her face.

@@.chef;&quot;Thank you, thank you. Remember, if you want to volunteer yourself on other days, register during the pauses at our counters! Anyways, back to the game!

The rules are very simple. So simple in fact that I should not even have to repeat them. We are expecting everyone of you to still understand how a simple game of TicTacToe works. Three symbols in a straight line - either vertically, horizontally or diagonal, it doesn&#39;t matter - and you win!
To get a symbol, you need to get our volunteers to cum. They got some performance enhancers so they are available for multiple shots. We wouldn&#39;t want you to fail because you are missing symbols, right?
You can place the symbol anywhere you want, but here is the twist: You are playing against the other team. On their side, they can put a symbol onto the same field as yours. By doing so, your own symbol is being pushed out and gone. At this point, you need to get a new symbol to put in. If it&#39;s not obvious, you can do the same to the enemy team!

To summarize: Make a straight line of symbols. Get the men to climax for a symbol. You can replace the enemy team&#39;s symbol with your own, deleting it.
&lt;&lt;if $r1.c_fall eq true&gt;&gt;Our single participant has the honor of stronger supplements in her man, resulting in easier orgasms. That way you have the time for placing them while keeping him occupied.\
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

Your eyes roll back into your head, your pussy gushing and burning with passion. A feeling of total bliss spreads throughout your body and your tongue works to slurp up all the smegma it can find, for it is yours and yours alone. You are surprised when a sudden flush of cum enters your mouth, but you double down and deepthroat it, swallowing everything with no chance of having it escape.

You look up at your man, only to see him staring at her. Strong feelings of rivalry build up in you and you know that there is only one way to solve this. You deepthroat him with all your might, down as far as you can, muffled moans escaping your shaking mouth. All that training in the earlier room payed off - No tears and no pain are to be felt. Only the soothing feeling of fullness in your throat. 
	You notice him looking back down at you as you gurgle on his shaft. You force your lips down for as much suction as possible, push your tongue upwards from below, and glide your mouth back as slowly as you can. Your left hand is working on your demanding snatch and you make sure he gets a full view of your fingers working it. Your eyes are fixated on his and you can feel his dick throbbing as his eyes connect with yours. [[You are to receive another juicy load!|r8tttgame2]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	@@.sarah;Sarah@@ is placing a round object into the middle field. You think how that should be good start, but don&#39;t want to waste too many thoughts on the correct workings of the game.

In fact, you even feel a bit envious. @@.jacky;Jacky@@ is in the same position as you, working the other guy&#39;s member. Above her, @@.cindy;Cindy@@ is leaning in to make out with him. You can catch their tongues twirling and her breasts slowly rising with every deep breath of hers. It is clear that their partner would not escape, as @@.cindy;Cindy@@ presses him back onto the game shelve. They both are controlling the men, using him as they please.
	Your fingers increase in speed, pushing faster and harder into your pussy with cock in your mouth. You bend back to give him an even better view while longingly watching the others work their man. You can see his glistening muscles even from here. Compared to the weak body in front of you, he would be sure to fulfill your every desire and need. \

&lt;&lt;if $p_traits.includes(&quot;kindahappy&quot;)&gt;&gt;\
	@@.player2;Smiling makes you feel happy, after all.@@
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

You believe you have been waiting some time now. Everything is a bit blurry. But it doesn&#39;t matter too much, because you, in fact, feel @@.player2;kind of &#39;&#39;good&#39;&#39;!@@
They must have given you something to improve the mood. Yes, indeed - That way you would not want to escape in the first place. @@.player2;//&quot;Only makes sense,&quot;//@@ you whisper to yourself.
The maid nods at that.

You hear footsteps and the door gets opened. The servant looks at the maid, who nods back, and then at you. @@.other;&quot;You are allowed to enter now.&quot;@@
You give him a smile. Finally!
@@.other;&quot;Please follow me.&quot;@@
Immediately you walk after him, yourself followed by the maid, back to the entrance. He walks next to the room @@.simon;Simon@@ entered and opens a door across from it. The servant bids you in and you waste no moment to step into the room. They close the door behind you.

Your eyes are wide open in surprise as you take in the new scenery. The room you entered looks like a spa! You are greeted with a big bathtub in the middle of it, full with rose petals and @@.simon;Simon@@ sitting in it, waiting for you. There are two spa tables, each with a pillow, towel and a tray with Oil Pots and a lamp. To the left there is a small half-room into the wall offering a shower. There are several oriental looking lamps hanging from the top and a few ornaments near the back wall. Behind the bathtub is a swing with green fabric, the chains being attached to the wooden interior contrasting the white walls. Everything seems a bit foggy, but you are sure that&#39;s only the incense of the oil lamps.

As your eyes trail the room, @@.simon;Simon@@ speaks up, @@.simon;&quot;You really are even more beautiful in person.&quot;@@
You instinctively @@.player2;//giggle//@@ at that, your mind clear of any worries.
@@.simon;&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid, my little bird. Come, enjoy a shower and join in me in this warm water.&quot;@@
He raises a small glass to you. @@.simon;&quot;Let&#39;s enjoy a bit of peace, yes?&quot;@@

[[You nod and hurry over to the shower.|r8_simon_shower]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="181" name="r8_simon_shower" tags="" position="6380,6857" size="100,100">You turn on the water and feel it flowing down your body. It&#39;s warmth comforts you. The droplets hitting the floor are the only sounds that break the silence. You realize that for whatever happened until now, this is the first time you can actively clean yourself. You cover your mouth, for you nearly let a whimper escape. This simple break of scenery and sudden comfort gives you more hope than you could have dreamed of. You pull your hair out of the way and just let the water pour on you.
It doesn&#39;t matter to you that @@.simon;Simon@@ is watching you through the see-through glass. This is nothing against what has happened so far. Actually, you subconsciously push out your right breast so he gets a better view. Some part of you wants to reward the old guy.
You smile dreamily as the water continues to hit your forehead, your cute nose, runs down your lips, down inbetween your breasts and down your legs. Indeed, for a short moment, you are at peace.

You also notice that @@.simon;Simon@@ does not interrupt. He simply watches you enjoying yourself. This makes you feel more at ease. Even so, you are aware that you can&#39;t be in the shower forever. Thoughts of the continuation of this situation are forcing itself into your mind, and your inner peace is destroyed. You are standing under a shower and the potential relief of it is gone. At its core, it still was just a simple shower.

You turn off the water and look at the old man. He raises his glass once again towards you, @@.simon;&quot;Just stunning, little bird. Take a glass of the tray on the table, will you? Let us enjoy this water. It smells brilliant.&quot;@@

You smile back at him and nod. @@.player2;&quot;//He really doesn&#39;t seem like that bad of a guy,//&quot;@@ you tell yourself.

You hand it to him without any thought. He places it on the outer side of the bathtub and offers you his hand.
@@.simon;&quot;Be careful when getting in, little bird.&quot;@@
You grab his hand and carefully step into the tub, lowering yourself into the water. He watched you, but no feeling of leering or ulterior motive was to be found. As you sit down, the warm, comforting water hugging your body nearly up to your shoulders, he hands you back your glass.
As you take it, the fresh smell of rose washes over you. Your body relaxes and you smile at him.

@@.simon;&quot;To a well earned moment, short as it may be,&quot;@@ he says, rising his glass a final time.
You nod and clink glasses with him. 

&lt;img class=&quot;imghover&quot; @src=&quot;setup.ImagePath + &#39;rounds/r8/r8_spa_whirl1.jpg&#39;&quot;&gt;

There is a sudden silence. He seems like he doesn&#39;t know what to say, though he keeps looking straight into your eyes. Your mind becomes a tad foggier as the incenses keep doing their work. You feel like the smell of the bath is protruding your nostrils and working itself into your brain, forcing all your intention on it.
He notices your shifting attention. @@.simon;&quot;I am aware that you might not exactly want to be here, ... But I can assure you that I only have the best intentions for you.&quot;@@
You look back up to him. He is leaning in, urging you with his eyes to come closer. You lean forward.
@@.simon;&quot;They are listening. If anything comes up, just play along,&quot;@@ he whispers to you. @@.simon;&quot;Just act like I told you a joke.&quot;@@
You stare at him for a few seconds, his expression serious, and you throw out an awkward laugh.
He raises an eyebrow and looks at you in surprise. He starts laughing himself, clearly genuine though. @@.simon;&quot;That must have been the worst fake laugh I have ever heard. Was the joke that terrible?&quot;@@
@@.player2;&quot;Uh... no. I mean,... No, it was funny!&quot;@@ you insist.
@@.simon;&quot;Right, right. In our age we realize when someone is lying, you know? But it&#39;s fine, don&#39;t worry.&quot;@@

He refills his glass. @@.simon;&quot;Now, beautiful bird, why don&#39;t you talk about-&quot;@@
@@.player2;&quot;Why do you call me a bird all the time?&quot;@@ you interrupt him. You realize and instantly apologize. 
He smiles.
@@.simon;&quot;Why, that&#39;s what I see when I look at you. Someone that was caged, but escaped and fights for their freedom. To leave behind the shackles of their environment. Spreading their wings to be free, becoming one with themselves. You are exactly that, little bird. You might just not know it yet. The question remains if you are going to fly into freedom or into the next cage.&quot;@@
He smiles at you, but this time you are not sure what to make of it. You did, in fact, not get what he was saying to you. But it sounded cool! And birds are beautiful creatures, right?
@@.player2;&quot;I&#39;m not sure if I followed that,&quot;@@ you @@.player2;//giggle//@@ at him, playing with your hair, @@.player2;&quot;but I like birds!&quot;@@

Another @@.player2;//giggle//@@ escapes your lips as you try to catch one of rose petals in the tub. Even though there are so many you can&#39;t manage to grab one. It&#39;s just too foggy in here! You are also not sure why, but everything feels so sluggish. As you look up at him, it takes some time to even register his face. And when you do, you just let out another @@.player2;//giggle//@@.
@@.simon;&quot;I take that as a yes, though talking might not be most inviting prospect anymore.&quot;@@
You are not really aware of what he is saying - You nearly got one of those rose petals! You are at it with both of your hands, having lost the glass sometime inbetween. But who cares, right?

@@.simon;&quot;Come, let me help you,&quot;@@ he says from behind, sending shivers down your spine. Your head instantly rolls back, wondering how he managed to get behind you that fast. Suddenly you are being lifted from under your shoulders.
@@.player2;&quot;//He&#39;s still strong enough to, like, do that!?//&quot;@@ you wonder in shock, not realizing that you are getting up with your own legs in accordance.
As you get up, you just stand there, smiling. The whole room smells so beautiful. You need that incense for your home.
@@.simon;&quot;Come here, beautiful,&quot;@@ he says, grabbing your hand and carefully leading you to a swing.
He sits down on it and pats on the empty space next to him.
You strike an impish smile. @@.player2;//&quot;He was being friendly to me, after all!&quot;//@@ you think, coming up with potential rewards for the old bear. That&#39;s when you know just the right thing!
You get onto your side of the swing and lie down onto your back, head resting on his upper leg. You @@.player2;giggle@@ even more when you feel him tense up, knowing that his blood might be rushing to something near your head. 

He caresses your chin and you look up at him with appreciation. You can&#39;t make out too much, for everything is blurry and fighting for your attention, but the outlines of his face are enough to make you feel at ease. You wonder if he is enjoying the look of your breasts right now. Should you push them up for him, for a better view? He surely would like that.

As he traces your lips, you whimper slightly in reaction. While you can&#39;t make out his eyes too well, you know for a fact that he is looking into yours. He must be, seeing how connected you feel to him at this very moment. 
You can feel his rough, old breaths. The tender movement of his fingers on your lips with utmost care to not make a wrong move. He does not jump on you. He respects you! A dreamy smile lits your face.

You look back at him, confused. @@.player2;&quot;Did I say something wrong?&quot;@@
Does he //not// want this, in fact? You have a lump in your throat, your eyes watering.
You are aware that this place is changing your perception. But he was genuine so far. One of the few people that seemed to care. Your thoughts go from him to your doubt about the integrity of your mind. Even if they are trying to do stuff to you, this felt real. No - You know it &#39;&#39;was&#39;&#39; real. He cared for you, that much you were sure about!

As your thoughts spiral out of control, he lifts you off the swing and stands up with you.
@@.simon;&quot;I fear our time has come to and end for now, little bird.&quot;@@
You grab his hand, but don&#39;t say anything. There was a hint of sadness in his voice. Definitely! You are imagining this after all! @@.player2;He cares for you!@@

@@.simon;&quot;Good. Fly high, little one.&quot;@@

Without another word he walks out of the room and you watch, standing still.
You are not exactly sure what happened. It was kind of abrupt after all. Then again, he wants so see you again! @@.player2;The knowledge of that makes you feel all warm inside.@@

The servant from before walks in from where @@.simon;Simon@@ left.
@@.other;&quot;If you would follow me,&quot;@@ he gestures outside. And that you do; following him.
He brings you back to the wardrobe and bids you in. Inside, the maid is waiting with a box in hands. Its the one containing your clothes. She is just standing there, smiling but unfocused still.
You take the box out of her hands. @@.player2;&quot;Thanks,&quot;@@ you say, to which she nods. She waits for you to get dressed.
As you look at your clothes, you remember what @@.simon;Simon@@ said. You watch the maid who doesn&#39;t seem to take in your presence at all.
You carefully fumble around the bottom of the box when you suddenly feel a small, cylindric shape. The maid seems to notice absolutely nothing. You turn away from her, move away the clothes and find a small hidden pocket. Slipping in your fingers, you are able to grab a pill.

	You recognize the pill as a &#39;&#39;//brainfluence//&#39;&#39;. Your mind felt clearer the last time you took it. You don&#39;t even ponder if you should take it.

There is no sight of @@.simon;Simon@@. He might have left already or they don&#39;t want you to see him. While the notion of tackling the both of them to escape is appealing, you are not stupid enough to attempt that. You walk up to them and get out of there.

You breath in through your mouth and a cold breeze goes down your throat. Even so, it quickly becomes warm again and puts you at ease, like a constant source of well-being.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="189" name="r9VR3" tags="" position="6957,8481" size="100,100">You sip on your coffee and press a few numbers on the keyboard. Another two weeks have gone by and you have been fully integrated. Who knew how easy it could be?
After your original deed, you were told to ask //&#39;&#39;Penny&#39;&#39;// for tips. She definitely knew her stuff! No wonder her work was always better than yours. With her help your blowjobs improved marginally!
Furthermore, you have realized the secret workings of the firm. Whenever Penny visited the boss, Sammy would enter a few minutes after the former left. Then it was either Tammy, Effie or Sunnie. After them, it was your turn. Just thinking about it makes you squirm.

// - Once again, @@.player2;Angie@@ - //, the monitor instructed you.
@@.player2;&quot;Woopsie!&quot;@@ you let out, having forgotten to input your numbers, @@.player2;//&quot;I&#39;m such a dizz!&quot;//@@
To continue the program, you carefully try to think about what key to press until that becomes too hard and you just press any one. The program starts up again, so it definitely was the right one - At least that it is what you are sure of.
A few spirals pop up on the screen. A few images on the side of sexy women pleasuring their master. A few guidelines on how to be the perfect playtoy. You are mesmerized. A number appears in the center of the screen. Some time goes by until you realize that you need to press something. You manage to press it though. The spirals change direction, the images get replaced and new guidelines on how to dress appear.

@@.other;&quot;-ie! ... Angie!&quot;@@
You snap back out of it and look to the left in shock. Tammy&#39;s smeared lipstick tells you that she is done. A smile forms on your lips as you get up. You remember last week when //&#39;&#39;Penny&#39;&#39;// looked like that. She didn&#39;t mind and neither did you. Instead, you were talking about how you both got the jobs in the first place. Appearantly, //&#39;&#39;Penny&#39;&#39;// was the wife of a banker and managed multiple retail clothing stores. You were taken aback - what did she need this job for? As it turns out, her spouse suggested a seminar for exponential business growth. There, she met your boss and was fascinated by his business skills. It was a small side-job to gain closer first-hand experience at first, but it proved to be her real passion. It was not long before she left her spouse and got some //real// first-hand experience. When you told her about meeting your boss in a job-searching seminar, you both instantly bonded over the shared experience.

As you rejoice in collegial memories, you slide your tongue along the bottom of his shaft and look into your boss&#39;s eyes.

&lt;img class=&quot;imghover&quot; @src=&quot;setup.ImagePath + &#39;rounds/r8/suite_blowjob_closeup.jpg&#39;&quot;&gt;
You have learned a lot in these last two weeks. The joy of being appreciated. The joy of being accepted. The joy of serving. Though it all amounts to nothing compared to the joy of his approving smile, his thrusts and your reward. You eagerly look forward to him flooding your mouth with his tasty substance as you prepare your lower hole with your fingers. It&#39;s already pulsing, having you suck with more enthusiasm and force than usual. He might not approve of your hurry, but his demeanor afterwards will result in an even better experience. You are playing him like a fiddle - he doesn&#39;t even notice! @@.player2;//You are such a genius.//@@

Your lower half [[pulses again.|r9r1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="190" name="r9r1" tags="" position="6957,8631" size="100,100">Your eyes rip open, your pussy squeezing around a phallic object. Confused and with heavy breaths you look around. No headset is to be found, your wrists, stomach and legs are constrained; all while some guy is lying on the floor and inserting something into your pussy from below. There is a blank monitor further ahead of you.

&lt;&lt;if $player.breastsize eq &quot;D&quot;&gt;&gt;\

	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

You feel him pushing a cylindric shape further into your hole. You instinctively try to jump away, but are still restrained. As you feel your lower half being filled, your warm walls surrounding the object suck it in with greed and a small, reluctant moan escapes your lips. You look down with flushed cheeks and the guy grins at you. 

With that, the monitor springs to life.

&lt;div class=&quot;dumb_terminal&quot;&gt;
	How long can you last without an orgasm? Win by holding out!
&lt;/div&gt;

A timer starts to tick down. You hear @@.cindy;Cindy@@ moaning from somewhere else. You can&#39;t make out any direction, for the room is too dark. It might be some speakers that have you all be connected, but does it really matter? Fact is that her genuine moans are @@.player2;turning you on@@. And if you want to win, that is bad.

The guy below you moves the object again, this time in a slow, rythmic fashion, in and out in its entire length; which is definitely long enough to have you anticipate more of it.

You need to think of a way to concentrate on something else. Within seconds, you have the perfect idea! Working in your boss&#39;s company always had you busy inputting stuff on that @@.player2;//stupid//@@ keyboard. You should just go through the process yourself!

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt; The next game has you enter letters on your keyboard. Each round increases in difficulty. Be ready to start with the click! &lt;/div&gt;

At the bottom there is another description: //Follow $player.playerName and her journey to become one of the greatest heroines ever. It all started when she realized she had magical powers...//
	That sounds kinda... tacky?&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

It depicts a woman from the back with a gun in her hands, peeking around the corner into a nightclub. //&#39;&#39;Detective $player.playerName&#39;&#39;// seems to be the title. The description at the bottom promises //a gripping adventure full of surprises, treason and love//.

He groans and licks his lips, staring back into your eyes. You lock yours with him, supporting- no, pushing your breasts a bit higher. If only to get his look back onto them, or for at least you to push into them for direct contact.

@@.other;&quot;Good. No reason to be afraid now, it will be fast.&quot;@@
He removes part of your top and inserts a needle into your left breast, then your right.
It starts slow, but within second an unimaginable heat emerges from your breasts, spreading throughout all of your body. You tremble, rip on your hair, kick against the couch. You only hear the black guy laughing, who then suddenly starts to massage your breasts.
You go limp. You moan. With the first touch, all the feelings turned into bliss. A soothing surge washes over you, rewiring something in you. You don&#39;t know what, but you know it is happening. As he continues to massage your breasts, you quickly decide that you just don&#39;t care. Whatever is happening, @@.player2;//it is good//.@@

He starts to slowly circle your right nipple, watching you intently. You bite your lower lip as the need for attention grows within you. For him to touch it, to suck it, yes, even to flick it. But he only circles the aerola, coming closer to your nipple at times, but backing off before reaching it in full. The need for attention grows into frustration.

At first you feel sort of disgusted, but then you think of all the ways you could show off your newfound cleavage. The prospect alone makes your pussy tingle. You stand up and feel the new weight on your chest. You seem to be sporting $player.breastsize cups now!

As you walk over and touch the pole, some sort of instinct takes over.
[[You find yourself giving a show!|r10_biggertits2][$p_traits.push(&quot;Cleavage lover&quot;)]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="243" name="r10_biggertits2" tags="" position="8201,10498" size="100,100">You know the movements perfectly.

You then let yourself fall on your behind and in one sweep pull yourself up into standing position by spinning once. You do another circle until you are in front of him. You grab the pole behind you with both arms and let yourself drop forwards. Your breasts stop right before his face, presenting him with all the cleavage he could muster. You lick your lower lip, turned on by all the attention you are receiving.

This is when you realize how arousing the attention on your two pillows of fat can be. Then again, it is only natural. Of course everyone would love to take a look it, and of course you would want them to see. Oh, all the outfits that pop up in your head, enhancing your breasts in so many ways.

You smile every time he whinces as you force your tongue along his most sensitive spots.

When he grunts another time, and your effort seems to be appreciated even more, you decide to take up the pace.

[[Cheers are welcoming you.|r10_end1][$r10.detective_won = true, $player.points += (50*$player.pointmod),$player.underwear = &quot;bunny2&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="261" name="r10_detectivestory_recombouncer2" tags="" position="9038,9750" size="100,100">Your body shoots upward. You look around, feeling disoriented, only to find that the bodyguard is gone. You are in front of door 69 though. An aching pain in your legs forces your attention. You see a small syringe sticking out - You pull it out in absolute horror. What did that bastard do to you? You go through a few scenarios in your head, all the while scraping off some cum from the ground, in front of your leaking pussy, and leading said cum absent-mindedly into your mouth. As hard as you try, you can&#39;t remember anything.

You force yourself to stand up and look around. You hear a flustered, male voice from behind Door 69. That&#39;s the door, isn&#39;t it?

Tapping into your special magical powers, you are able to extract energy that is going to overwhelm your enemy and weaken them considerably. At the same time, you sap some of their lifeforce. It takes a toll on your body though, so you have never used it more than once in a fight. Also, you remember your body changing a bit everytime you used it. Really, why would you depend on this !?

These men are all the same and manipulating them is so easy. It&#39;s as if they drop their brains at the smallest sight of a good-looking woman. And that you were. They all fell before you. You might not have been the best in school, but in the real world your skills are top-notch. Stupid math would never have prepared you for social interactions, after all! It&#39;s all practice and more practice.

With the bait thrown, you giggle again and look at the cinema screen, waiting for the movie to start. Out of the corner of your eye you can see the guy squirming uncomfortably. He must be unsure on whether you are egging him on. But you got just the right weapon for that. As you sit there and keep your eyes on the screen, you slip a finger right into your mouth, slowly gliding it in and out. You put in a bit of tongue work too, if only to ensure some spit on your finger for him to see. It always made those stupid men eager to get at it.

As if you wouldn&#39;t have known better, you hear him clear his throat while moving a hand across your back. You lick your lips again, nipples stiff with anticipation. @@.player2;&quot;//Too easy,//&quot;@@ you think, pussy tingling. You knew what you wanted and you were about to get it. His hand rests on your shoulder, and you both seem to be waiting for the film to start.

Biting your lip, you wait. You can hear his heavy breaths. You are sure a tent has already built up, just for you. Next, you only had to- 
The film starts and he suddenly grabs you, forcing you slightly on top of him.

You look at him in shock - And look back at the other guy behind you. Did he notice? What if- 
The black dude takes your head and forces you to look at him. You whimper at this, his strong eyes infiltrating your mind. Your lovespot gushes with need and you are oh [[so ready to give in.|r10_endfinal3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="292" name="r10_endfinal3" tags="" position="10040,9786" size="100,100">&lt;img @src=&quot;setup.ImagePath + &#39;rounds/r10/r10_dream_cinema3.png&#39;&quot;&gt;\

His hand slips onto your neck and he gives you an ever so light push. You just fall forwards and press your lips onto his. His hands fall down to your ass, pinching and grabbing it, giving you enough support to not fall down. He was @@.player2;strong@@ too!
As you kiss, you can smell his hot breath. Intoxicating honey that spreads in your nostrils. You exhale in response, his tongue entering your mouth. He gives you no chance to dance with it as he dominates your every movement. You just follow along, letting him explore your mouth.
You whimper and moan ever so slightly more, and more, increasing need forcing your hands down to his crotch. You unbuckle his jeans and open them, revealing his pants. You immediately try to go for his cock, not seeing anything due to your focusing on not being completely overwhelmed by his experienced tongueplay. You only grin and giggle into his mouth ever so all-knowingly shy upon touching his gigantic manhood. 
Your breaths even heavier, you slide a bit forwards with your upper body, making sure that your juicy tits brush alongside his chest, all the while you grip his member with utmost force and position it readily. You slip your skirt over his dick, slowly pull down his confining underwear, and position his member right below your needy, wet pussy. You giggle again, exchanging breaths and spit with him, knowing that you have one surprise left.
You lower your pussy onto his cock; Nothing to be removed, as you are in fact going commando. As he realizes this, you feel his tongue stop for a short moment - Which is when you take control. You lower yourself completely, engulfing his whole manhood, stretching yourself to your limits. You push your breasts into his chest even more by doing so, gripping him harder than before for the pleasure of entrance is the most beautiful thing on this world, and force your tongue into his mouth.
Registering that he lost his dominant role, he suddenly starts to thrust his dick as deep as he possibly can back into your womanhood. Muffled, repressed screams escape your lips, but his mouth catches most of your reactions. He grabs you by the hair, his fingers burying into it, massaging your scalp as he pounds you like the needy bitch that you are.
You only increase your speed in response, sliding along his whole shaft as intensely as you can. It is only when his other hand on your ass stealthily slips to your butthole, spreading and rubbing it, that you give in.
You disengage his lips, your upper body arching back, seeking support on the seats behind you. His thrusts increase in intensity, your moans in volume. @@.player2;&quot;Yes-, God, yes-&quot;@@ you start to scream, not paying any attention to anything in this room anymore. You lost all control, but you don&#39;t need that right now, for he thrusts even harder into your drooling snatch. You moan and whince, biting your lips while looking down at him. He still stares at you with his passionate eyes- Oh, those eyes. Those fucking eyes that have you- @@.player2;God, yes- Yes-F-&quot;@@ you start, orgasm building, and then, right at the moment you have waited for so long-

&lt;hr&gt;

You blink, panting heavily. The headset had been removed. Your stool is wet from your juices, your chin full of drool. You look around, desperate for someone. But the room looks empty. You bite your lip and pull your hair in frustration, instantly starting to rub your clit with the other. You need that orgasm. You need that dick. @@.player2;You fucking need a good fuck.@@
With professional clitwork it is not long before you cum, your moan filling the whole roam, but you are left feeling somewhat dissatisfied even so.
You sit in the chair, collecting and regaining thoughts that you might have orgasmed away right then and there, before finally standing up and beginning to walk towards the now opened door in front of you. 
While your goal is to reach [[the next challenge|r11start]], you subconsciously hope for a dick.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="293" name="r11start" tags="" position="10042,9971" size="100,100">With red cheeks, you wander around in search of your next objective.

She seems to be sobbing, showing her body off to the audience. Her blue fishnet dress allows everyone to see even the slightest part of her body. You are not sure, but you believe that her proportions have increased a tiny bit?
Even so, you wander on, licking your dry lips. This is not what you were searching for.

You can see her having bigger breasts than before! @@.player2;&quot;//Not too shabby,//&quot;@@ you think, licking your lips.

You aren&#39;t too sure if it fits her, but whatever floats her boat!
